I was looking for a used car so I purchased 5 Carfax Reports.  The good thing is I found one on my first try and now I have 4 carfax reports left.  I have 59 days to use them or lose them.  If you are looking to buy a used car and need a carfax report, why pay $35 for just 1 when you can pay $15. Thats a savings of $20.



You can come and give  me the car VID # and I will look up the car and print out the Carfax Report for you.



Cash and Pick Up only



Email for info.

I got a 1999 Honda Accord LX Coupe 4 Cyl., manual 5 spd, power windows, power locks, cruise control, perfect air conditioning and heat, fully customize with 19" rims, racing suspension, intake system, hi-flo cat, fresh paint, lip kit, custom lights, and H.I.D. headllights, it is a definate head turner.  It has a rediculous sound system fearturing an almost new pioneer head unit 

IT NEEDS NOTHING!!!! Car runs solid, inspection done recently, and ready to drive home, then out to show off, and back home again. I bought the car 3 years ago and drove it in Florida and this winter will be the first time this car sees snow.  No rust!!! The car never once left me stranded never had problems with it.  I am a mechanic so you know this car was well taken care of.  

Well maintianed only put synthetic oil in it every 3,000 miles.  It has 150,000 highway miles on it.  Only reason why i'm selling is because I grew out of the whole tuner phase and I'm ready for something different.  It needs someone to continue to give it the TLC it already recieves.  

I also have some front and rear sway bars that I never got a chance to put on that I'll throw in if you want. I'M ASKING $4000 OR BEST OFFER.  In no rush to sell the car I still drive it every now n then so no bull only real offers from serious buyers.  If u just browsing, tell someone you know with money about her.  Call/text (617)980-2495.  Only Serious Buyers!!!!!

Read more below...




This is 2004 Town Car is a stunning example of a wonderful flagship sedan from Lincoln.  Equipped with the Ultimate
Package and the L version, there aren't many options this car doesn't have.  As far as I can tell, the only option
it doesn't have is a sunroof.  The list of the other options appears endless:




Navigation
Xenon Headlights
6-Disc CD Player


Dual Power Seats w/ Lumbar
Heated Seats (front and rear)
Remote Fuel Door Release

This is truly a southern vehicle.  The car was orignally sold in Florida, and migrated to NH at 66k when I purchased
it 2 years ago.  It has 90k miles on it now, with no problems at all since I purchased it.  It has two new rear
Michelin Tires on it, and service has been performed every 3k miles.  This car is the best highway car I have ever
seen, and anyone who rides in the back of this car will agree.  The 6" factory stretch makes the rear legroom better
than the front seats - even with the seats all the way back!  With rear audio/climate controls, Navigation and Voice activated
radio/nav controls - this car does it all.

I have found that I no longer drive the car like I used to, and have several other vehicles to choose from in my own
fleet.  I hate to see the car sit around and not be enjoyed and I really hate to sell it.  These cars will get
increasingly harder to find in the near future as Ford Motor Company will be terminating the Panther Platform 
next year.  The book value has gone up steadily in the first 2 quarters of this year, so the car should hold its
resale value quite well. 

This car's NADA value is around $16,800.  Just in case you don't believe me I hotlinked the KBB image to the acutal KBB site. This car will sell itself - you probably are not going to find one nicer.  First to come see and drive this car will buy. This would make a great livery car or the ultimate commuter vehicle.

Need to sell my 2006 G35 sedan ASAP. I'm relocating to NYC and can no longe keep the car, nor do I need one there. These 2006's easily sell for at least 2-3k more than I am asking, just check Cars.com. Furthermore, I am transferring to you, free of charge, a full bumper to bumper 3 year warranty that I paid $2k for in April when I purchased the vehicle. The car is totally covered for another 30k+ miles and 3 years. Here's a bit about the car: White on grey heated leather, loaded with usual luxury features like sunroof, multi disc CD, alloy rims, xenon lights, power everything, etc. Car is fully serviced and I have all receipts for any service performed during my ownership. Car has had no accidents and I can provide the VIN if you would like to run a carfax on it's background. Car has 77k miles on it currently. The price is firm. I've already dropped it twice in an effort to sell quick. The price is a steal not just for this year, but also the fact it has a full 3 year warranty. I have plenty of pictures available and can provide whatever information you need. Car is available to be shown in the Boston area or near Quincy where I currently work, anytime during the week. I am typically in NYC Fridaya through Monday however. Please drop an email if you're interested, would like to sell the car ASAP.

We are right on the Maine border, less than 90 minutes from Boston.  The truck is a 1986 Chevy, 6.2 liter diesel engine, 4 speed standard and it runs good.  It has a mechanics body that is in good shape.  The 24' bucket works good.  We use it regularly and will work good as is.  It could use some minor work on the lift arm controls, and the bucket itself needs the safety pin to be replaced, but it is a good truck.  We would keep using it, but we just got another bucket truck with a higher reach.

I have reduced the price from $14,950  to the AMAZINGLY LOW PRICE of $12.900 in order to sell it quickly.  This is a black Sonata GLS with the special package that has wood grain on the front dash and the low pollution PZEV 4 cylinder engine.  This was my son's car but he moved to a city where he doesn't need a car.  The car's sticker was $21,600 and only has 16,600 miles and the remainder of the 5 year bumper to bumper warranty to 60,000 miles.  It has a beige cloth interior and the ipod connector to play the ipod through the radio.  The steering wheel has radio controls along with other nicities like automatic lighting in the interior.  We are very motivated to sell this car to avoid furhter expenses and have lowered the price almost $2,000 below our original asking price and much lower than any comparable vehicle on the market with this low mileage.  The rear passenger side has a small scratch from a parking lot mishhap, pictured below, which is another reason we lowered the price so much.  This is a great car and will last forever.  My daughters each have Hyundais that are 9 years old and still driving like new cars.  The Sonata is a great car for the road, very comfortable and quiet.  Don't miss the opportunity to get a great car for a very low price.

1989 PONTIAC 20TH ANNIVERSARY TURBO TRANS AM

VIDEO OF THE CAR HERE &gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TebAhVixBCw

In 1989, the GM struck again; they applied the GNX's world-beating turbocharged and intercooled V-6 to the underpowered Firebird with spectacular results. Unlike the Regal or the S-10, the Firebird was born to run, and with the turbo V-6 it ran with the best in the world. The turbo Trans Am finally had the grunt to match its looks. Car and Driver managed a 4.6-second 0-60 run; that's still extreme performance today and simply mind-blowing in 1989. It also handled well and topped out at more than 160 mph. Forget about bit players like the Mustang and Camaro--they weren't even in the same game. The turbo Firebird smoked the nominal GM performance icon, the Corvette, and out-accelerated the expensive Italians, the Ferrari Testarossa and Lamborghini Countach. Again, that's serious speed. If you wanted a clearly faster car in 1989, you had to step up to the unavailable exotics--the Porsche 959 and Ferrari F40. Maybe it's just me, but I think the 20th Anniversary TA is a stunningly compelling car. The car was quicker than even the mighty Trans Am SD-455 of yore and upstaged the Corvette; doing that with a turbo V-6 Trans Am in a plain white wrapper took some audacity. The turbo TA also has rarity in its side; the fanatics only produced 1,555 examples before the corporate no-fun police were able to restrain them.

THIS IS NOT A LOW MILEAGE, UNMODIFIED, GARAGE QUEEN. IT HAS ALMOST 112,000 ENJOYABLE MILES ON IT. PUT THERE BY THE ORIGINAL AND ONLY OWNER. ALL THE BUGS HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT OF IT AND LOOKS AND RUNS GREAT! THIS WHITE TURBO TRANS AM HAS T-TOPS AND LEATHER. THE SEATS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN REDONE AS WELL AS THE PAINT AND 4 NEW RIMS. THE CAR LOOKS SUPER. IT HAS A LOT OF UPGRADES SUCH AS A REDONE MOTOR WITH HEAD WORK WITH LESS THAN 7,000 MILES ON IT. THE TRANSMISSION IS ALSO REDONE WITH ABOUT 600 MILES ON IT AND SHIFTS EXCELLENT ( HAD TO GO TO THE DOCTOR 3 TIMES WITH WHIPLASH) HAS MANY OTHER GOODIES SUCH AS A T-49 TURBO, 52 POUND INJECTORS, 3" DOWN PIPE AND EXHAUST, TORQUE CONVERTER, HEAVY DUTY STARTER, ALTERNATOR, FUEL PUMP AND BATTERY, HAWK RACING BRAKES, PROPORTIONING VALVE, LINE LOCK, TRANSLATOR, K& N FILTER,ALCOHOL SYSTEM WITH CHIP, SCAN MASTER, ROLL BAR AND HARNESS, ETC. COMES WITH THE OWNERS KIT. THE TURBO EMBLEMS ARE NOT ON THE CAR BUT I HAVE THEM AS WELL AS A FEW OTHER EMBLEMS. THE "TURBO" SIGN ON THE BACK THAT'S UNDER THE EAGLE IS TAPED OVER WITH BLACK TAPE AND HAS BEEN SINCE I GOT THE CAR. (CAN YOU SAY “SLEEPER?”) THE CAR TURNS MID TO LOW 11'S MOST ANY DAY. ALSO COMES WITH A VARIETY OF EXTRA PARTS SUCH AS 8 EXTRA RIMS, 2 OF THE RIMS HAVE DRAG RADIALS ON THEM AND ARE ALMOST BRAND NEW, ORIGINAL AIR FILTER AND CANISTER AND OTHER SUCH STUFF. 

ASKING PRICE - $15,900

Beautiful 1991 Mustang GT Convertible. The car is a automatic V8 and the motor is all original and stock. Motor runs excellent and never had any problems in the 3 years iv had the car. The intake and valve covers were polished, its very clean when you pop up the hood. It has 126,000 miles. The car is black on the outside with the grey interior, The car is very clean on the inside everything is in good shape, looks like new from the inside. The car has no rust anywhere on the car, its rust free. The paint is in good shape and the convertible top is still the original top and is in good shape as well. It also has the trunk w. no rack on it which most people prefer and like. the cobra R's in the picture are no longer on the car as well as the headlight covers. the car comes w. pony wheels. All in all the car is an excellent car w. no problems. Safe to say its one of the better GT's on craigslist. Asking $5,200 OBRO

** Honda Accord 1997 **

1997 Honda Accord.  Runs and drives excellent, even on the highway.  New brakes, newer tires, power windows, sunroof, CD player, keyless entry,  A/C blows ice cold, heat blows hot.  A very safe, reliable car, amazing gas mileage!  158,000 miles.  Timing belt and water pump have been done as manufacturers maintaince schedule suggest at 120,000.  DO NOT buy a honda with high mileage unless this has been done.  Not a fun or cheap repair.  Mechanically, this car runs perfect!  Come take it for a test drive.  There is some rust, dings, dents, scratches...but normal for age of car.  Excellent car for long commute to work, students, or new teenage drivers.  Call today to schedule a test drive.  Theres nothing you need to do to this car but drive it home!

Incredibly sturdy, reliable car. All receipts for oil changes, minor repairs for the past three years. Most of the work was done at the Good News Garage in Cambridge--whose owners are Car Talk's Tappett brothers. They will vouch for the car, or check it out for you if you want. You may also bring it to your own mechanic. Be sure to check out the CarFax. No accidents or other issues. This is a great car with many miles still to go. Brakes and rotors done in July; exhaust system replaced a year ago. Not too many bells and whistles such as power windows/door locks, which means less that can break down. But a few that count, such as ice cold air conditioning. Driven only 17,000 miles in the past three years. (Total mileage is 127,000.) Garaged half-time. Body is in excellent condition, as is original paint. Four snow tires included--used only two seasons. Eager to sell, moving to Michigan where I have a new car.

1965 Ford Mustang Coupe - $15,000 negotiable 

VIN# 5F07C393215 

This car is a must see. It is a 1965 Ford Mustang Coupe. It is Caspian Blue with black racing stripes and black interior. It has the original 289 CI engine and 3 speed manual transmission. The engine has been bored .040 over. The heads have been completely rebuilt with new springs, valves and hardened valve seats to run unleaded gasoline. It has long tube tri-Y headers and an Edelbrock performer intake with a Holly 4 barrel carburetor that was rebuilt at the same time as the motor. Restoration was finished in 2007. She still needs a little work, but is a blast to drive! 

There are a couple boxes of parts that go with it and more on the way. The car is registered in a state where titles are not given for anything older than 1985. So a bill of sale will be used. I have all receipts for parts purchased and outside work completed during the restoration. 

Please call 907-602-3422 with any questions. I am asking $15,000 but that is negotiable, so make me an offer.

1980 MGB Convertible - Restored over the past 2 years. 



Carmine Red - Interior Completely Restored from bare metal. Body redone last summer, Rocker panels replaced, wheel well trouble spots fixed.... It looks awesome No Rust!!! 60k Miles, Engine Purrs like a kitten. Doesn't need a thing.... just a new home. 



Please email me with additional questions. I am motivated to sell so I can pay my ex-wife's lawyer, my girlfriend and keep myself out of jail... It's not as bad as it sounds, I just figured it would add some levity to the usual "my cah is wicked pissah and I'm selling it so I can buy that cabinet to show off my shot glass collection..." 



Drop me a line and we can arrange to take it out for a ride. Call/Txt 781 718 0865

Now that I got your attention, I have for sale a 1973 Convertable Cougar. Tough economic times force me to sell this beauty. It is in terrific condition, repaint was in 2007 ( stripped down to bare metal, no rust anywhere), 65,000 original miles on 351C, new radiator, master cylinder, and Top. Originally from FL, this car has never seen a snow day, it was garaged for Winters. Rides and drives like a charm and turns heads everywhere it goes. I have put seat covers on original seats figuring that I would have them restored someday. The back seat is in great shape ( hardly used). Inside door panels could use replacing, some cracks from age. It is ready to go! No scammers with phony Bank checks or Western Union Money grams, nor tirekickers and dreamers need to show. Serious buyers only! Ask any questions.

1999 Chevrolet Prizm Sedan 4D, 118,000 miles, runs great...

This third generation Prizm came standard with a front stabilizer bar in the handling package, and is equipped with Toyota’s 1.8 Liter L 1ZZ-FE, I4 Engine.  It has FWD, Automatic transmission, super cool air conditioning, dual air bags, power steering, AM/FM stereo and cassette deck.  The exterior is dark green and the interior is grey cloth.

We just replaced the power steering pump, left front caliper, and left inner tie rod end.  The only one minor issue with the car is that it slowly loses oil.  No mechanic has given us a definitive cause, but we’ve been told it is not a major issue; adding a quart of oil every few weeks solves the problem.  Otherwise, we know of NO MECHANICAL ISSUES, and the CAR RUNS GREAT!

The interior and exterior have minor cosmetic issues, including small scratches, a white scuff mark on the front bumper, and a crack in the driver's side interior door panel.  Overall, the exterior condition and interior fabric is “good” and interior plastic panels are "fair."  Mechanics are "good" to "excellent."

Please contact me if you are interested in the car.

My wife and I love this car.  We hate to see it go. We have a baby on the way, so her family had talked us into buying a brand new car with a warranty to cover us especially when having this baby. We'll a week after we got this new car. I lost my job. Now, were in debt, living at her grandmothers, and have to see my beautiful machine go. 
It's a forest green color. 
no dents no dings
one tiny patch of bubble rust not noticeable
has slight mechanic problems
and it needs a window on the front passenger side
Asking for a 1,000 or best offer 
THANK YOU

Trustworthy old friend. She starts reliably.
Mileage: 153,208
Blue Book value is $3500.
Color is blue.
It has the "winter package" (heated seat, defrosting side mirrors...)
The A/C does not work, nor does the tape player.
Everything else runs well- it's been a dependable car.

1989 Volvo 740 Turbo - very safe car.  Automatic.  

Need a good reliable car with low miles?  This is a great deal for a 1989 Volvo 740 Turbo - it's in great shape.  I bought it 3 years ago from a guy who's grandmother passed away down in Florida - no rust and body in great condition.  Car has been stored inside until the last 3 months.  

Really so sad to see this car go but I'm finally ready for a newer car.  Currently not-inspected (was up for inspection in September).  

Immediate Problems: 
rear brakes, overdrive fuse relay (cheap fix)

Eventual Problems:
Both front struts and strut mounts which will probably run you about 500 - 600.  However this are NOT a safety issue it just causes an annoying noise.  

Work Done to the Car within the last 15K:
New tires, new ball joints, rear control arm (suspension) / bushing - both sides, spark plugs, fuel filter, air filter, ignition wire set, temperature sensor, rear muffler, TIMING BELT, 

Mileage about 130K - yes only 130K - you won't find an older turbo with mileage like this ANYWHERE.  For details call 617.584.1450 or reply to this posting.  Serious offers only and 1000

-------  MAKE ME AN OFFER.  I REALLY WANT TO SELL THIS CAR -------------- 

Thanks for looking.

I bought this truck for my kid who just got his license six months ago.  The truck was bought from a long retired state trooper who drove this truck daily.  At 84, his wife wouldn't let him drive anymore.  He really didn't want to let it go.

I drove it home and it sat for about three months as I did some rust repair on the vehicle.  If you notice the top and rear of the bed and along the bottom rails (under the chrome strip) It had some scratches and rust. Also some rust through spots.  I repaired the rust and rolled on Duraliner.  It came out excellent!  Looks great.  The rest of the body is in pretty good shape.  A couple of spots and minor scratches, but it looks real good.

pic is of the car this week



Not looking forward to this but guess it's about that time. I have way too many cars and need to scale down a bit.

This 944 has a brand new timing belt, water pump, balance shaft belt and pulley, clutch, tires, brakes (cross drilled and slotted, hawk pads), suspension(koni adjustable), exhaust(porsche), has been repainted, Italian wheels, new kuhmo tires (currently have 4 sumitomo htr z3's on brand new as well) , new battery, painted calipers, sway bars, dash pad, brand new sound system, new weltmeister springs, K and N air filter, brakes just bled with ATE Super Blue, new steering shaft, just changed oil mobil 1 10w 30, new radiator and fans as well as hoses, put in a new wiring harness, put i brake mastenr cylinder as well, did the valve cover gasket, I have all service records from myself and the previous owner. The car is guards red. The window switches and rear wiper are functional as well as door locks which tend to be fussy on these cars. Air conditioning works as well. Car comes with a million extras as well as original wheels and tires etc...just aligned the car at Porsche this week

This car would be perfect as a daily driver ( not in winter) or right at home on the track and at autocross events
I have easily put in $18500 into this car since 2005 

On July 15th I got rear ended in this car so it will not have a normal title but all it really needs is a bumper. The reason they totaled it was because the rear body panel they didnt want to try pulling out and if they bought the panel from porsche since I was at the dealer it would have been $519 for just the panel. I could of got a panel for nothing but I just bought a 2002 carrera instead

Im flexible on price of course but would like to make back as much as possible since this car has been well sorted out. Dont be shy make an offer but come see it looking for offers above $5219 if possible but just try me im friendly not gonna get insulted

630   - 728- 4912
866-    668- 7466
would consider a trade for another porsche or bmw maybe depending on what it was
plenty of pictures available upon request

Beautiful Chrysler Crossfire SRT-6 automatic.   Transferable factory Care Plus Warranty to 2012 or 100,000 mileage.    Dark metallic gray.    61,000 miles.  Following is a write-up by someone else, which will give you a sense of the superb car for the money, and the difference between the SRT-6 and the standard Crossfire.

This is a low volume supercar that Chrysler did a very poor job publicizing. Mercedes AMG based and built supercharged coupe and the best available in the country. Manufactured in Germany on Mercedes and AMG assembly lines. Upgrades engineered by AMG ( Mercedes' high performance division) in cooperation with Chrysler's SRT (Street and Racing Technology division). This car represents the single greatest achievement of the multi-billion dollar collaboration between Mercedes and Chrysler, and is not a standard Crossfire. It is an upscale, limited production almost $50,000 supercar built on Mercedes SLK AMG performance components - fame, suspension, brakes and engine, with a uniquely styled custom body and includes: 349 H.P. (actual) highly efficient supercharged Mercedes 3.2 liter all-aluminum single overhead cam V6 engine with variable 3 valve technology. (Aftermarket kit available with pulley and modified ECU to increase H.P. up to 450). Heavy duty 5 speed Autostick with direct shift software - the same transmission as in $500K Mercedes/McClaren with 650 H.P. Powerful AMG Brembo 14" brakes stop within 2 feet of new Porche Carrera from 70 MPH.. Wind tunnel engineered fixed wing rear spoiler and front chin spoiler. Custom sport springs, HD shocks, independent rear suspension, 1" lower than a standard Crossfire. Advanced Mercedes electronic stability control system specially tuned for high performance adds expanded capability with safety. Black pearl paint with black leather interior. All luxury features including power seats, windows, air conditioning, Recaro leather seats ($2500 each), quality Infinity stereo with disc player, etc. Very light weight - under 3100 lbs. Super performance, 0-60 in 4.8 seconds, yet still up to 26 MPG. Rock solid, no flex, "high hertz" chassis allows the incredible suspension and brakes to optimize performance - in all, over $20,000 in AMG factory upgrades over a standard Crossfire.

*DRIVER SIDE FOG LIGHT MISSING (UNNOTICABLE)

*PASSENGER SIDE WINDOW CAN, BUT SHOULD NOT BE ROLLED DOWN ALL THE WAY, SOMETHING INSIDE THE DOOR IS SCRATCHING THE WINDOW, SOUNDING AS IF IT WILL CRACK...NOT IMPORTANT ENOUGH FOR ME TO WANT TO FIX.

BRAKE PADS, ROTORS, AND DRUMS BRAND NEW 7/26/10


NOTE****WHEN I GOT THE CAR, IT WOULD NOT PASS INSPECTION DUE TO THE CADILLAC CONVERTER...I GOT A BRAND NEW ONE PUT ON.(UNIVERSAL). CAR PASSED INSPECTION...CHECK ENGINE LIGHT HAS COME BACK ON, HAD CAR DIAGNOSED...THE UNIVERSAL CONVERTER IS TOO SMALL FOR THE CAR SO WHEN THE CAR HEATS UP, IT MESSES WITH THE SENSOR. SO IN ORDER FOR THE LIGHT TO GO OFF AND STAY OFF, THE CONVERTER NEEDS TO BE FOR THE MAKE OF THE CAR...

For sale is a 1997 Blue Saturn SC1. I am selling it because we will soon be having a baby and looking for a more family friendly car. It starts with no problem, and has been driven daily. Odometer reads 249,910. The transmission was replaced in January of 2008 and the starter in November 2008. The car has 4 all season tires, and 2 winter tires (which are currently mounted in the front). In order to pass inspection, the car needs new brake pads and CV joint on the front drivers side (the car currently squeaks and grinds when coming to a stop) and a new bulb for the headlight .Also, drivers window is stuck, needs to be reset on track. Kelly Blue Book values the car in its condition at $1300, but I am only asking $600 or best offer. I have a CD Player with a 10 disc CD changer (installed) for an extra $75 for anyone interested. Please feel free to call John with any questions. (603)731-3605. Thanks!

1973 Triumph TR6 Convertible

4 speed 2.5L 6 cyl,  cassette stereo, heater, “appliance” white, black top. interior and 
accent stripes.  107K mi total with 20K mi on engine and about 50mi on new clutch.   

This is a 1973 model manufactured in Nov. 1972 which, by US Federal law, must be titled 
as a 1972.  

Car comes with a free and clear NH antique title. 

It is an essentially all original, Southern US (Georgia and South Carolina) car where 
rust and corrosion are rare, especially on a garage kept “Summer driver” like this one. 

It has been well maintained all its life by its two owners with heavily documented receipts for
parts purchases.

Most recent refurbishments include brake and clutch hydraulics, clutch, exhaust system, convertible top, front suspension bushings, links, tie rods, ball joints, bearings, interior upholstery, carpets, paint, stripes, ALL filters, windshield, bottom and frame rustproofing, Pertronix electronic ignition, tune-up, engine and carburetor rebuild (20,000mi).   

Car was originally red but has had two white resprays in the 1980’s and most recently in the early 2000’s
with nearly zero weather exposure since.  

All sheet metal panels, seams, floors, trunk, frame etc. are absolutely straight and as close to factory 
condition as possible for an almost 40 year old car.  There is no evidence of collisions, rot, heavy 
bondo or exposure to corrosive road conditions.  The only exceptions are the RH rocker panel appears replaced years ago, and both front fenders seem to have been removed and replaced at some time with 
a few bolts missing.  

The car is currently being sorted after a new clutch installation.  Some driveline joints need to 
be re-phased (aligned properly) which involves pulling the shafts and lining them up the way 
they were originally.  

EVERYTHING works well, engine is VERY strong and the entire car is in turnkey condition.  

This car will give its next owner MANY years of “thumbs up” driving pleasure and is VERY 
fairly priced at $12, 995 which is far less than finding a cheaper priced one and “restoring”
it to this condition.
To see this car before it goes to the Hershey fall meet next week please call John at 603-769-7797. It is currently garaged in Amherst NH

VIN #: WVGGH77L34D048571   mileage: 86K







 bumper to bumper Extended warranty with one year or 7k miles still left on it





I am selling a very rare find. It is a V10 TWIN Turbo Diesel. 30 MPG Highway!!! STILL UNDER BUMPER TO BUMPER WARRANTY!!!. The car is fully loaded including heated steering wheel Heated seats front and rear, and factory navigation. This car was over $75,000 when it was new. The car is in outstanding condition inside and out. This one has about EVERY CONCEIVABLE OPTION INCLUDING FACTORY NAVIGATION!!!! The turbo-diesel engine has better fuel economy than the V6. It also provides 553 lbs.-ft. of torque: almost twice that of the V8 engine. The enhanced low-end power makes the Diesel Touareg better suited for towing, off-road driving, and acceleration off the line. The Touareg can tow up to 7,700 pounds. Its zero-to-sixty acceleration time is 7.5 seconds. 







Possible trades considered but they have to be VERY reasonably priced for me to consider them.







Classic cars also considered.

This car only has 79800miles on it. It runs and is very good on gas.  I've finally given in and decided to buy a new car.  Definitely has scratches and the front right fender was replaced so it has a matte finish.  Could use new shocks but not necessary.  Has gray clothe interior and a radio that is not a from the factory.  Good car to get you to and from work in a city.

I am selling my flat black 1993 Jeep Cherokee sport. It has a 4" custom suspension lift, welded D35 rear axle and D30 front axle w/ 4:56 gears front and rear, a H.O. 4.0 Liter motor with 142, 000 miles on it and an ax-15 5-speed transmission with an NP231 transfer case., BFG Mud Terrain 35x12.5x15 tires, custom front bumper and rubber coated floors. The interior is in decent shape considering it was a woods truck. No carpeting and floors have been rubber coated. I bought this Jeep with the intentions of building it up but moved and don't have the funds to finish now.







It runs and drives great and has no leaks. Will need a little work to be road worthy or a great toy for the woods. It needs the transfer case shift linkage to be customized to be fixed.  I am not in a hurry to sell and I am still fixing it here and there but times are tight and I would rather be spending my money on my 89 Wrangler YJ.





I am asking $1800 or B.R.O. and also open to trades for YJ Wranglers and parts for YJ Wranglers and cash, try me.

I do NOT have a title and it is registered in NH at the moment.

I check emails daily if you have any questions or would like to check it out.

DODGE CUMMINS DIESEL P/U 2wd, 8' bed.  I've had it since 1991 and it has been a great truck.  It's never been wrecked or painted although there is not much left of the paint that is on it.  It runs and drives excellent but looks very ugly.  The diesel engine alone is worth the price of the truck.  Call Michael at 508-725-9000.

The trailer is a 44ft triple axle with three 7,000lb. torsion axles and electric brakes on all 6 wheels.  This is a trailer for hauling either a funny car or dragster.

Also, comes with compressor and is plumbed in and out with air.  There is also an observation deck on top of the trailer.

I am looking to sell my 79 CJ 7. It is all rebuilt for off road use. I just recently had a new 258 cu. engine put in, Howell fuel injection kit, new clutch, Dana 44 widetrack axles with detroit lockers, and many, many other parts to list. I am looking to get rid of it due to I need a comuter vehicle seeing that I am driving almost 200 miles a day so it must go. I have invested over $15K into this thing and know that I will not get nearly as much as I invested but it's just sitting around so $5500 and it's yours. Shoot me an email. Thanks.

Hate to do it, but I'm putting up my 1.8T swapped cabrio for sale. I need a pickup truck. 

I bought the car a little over 2 years ago from a guy nearby in Somerville, MA. He runs a muffler shop and works on a little of VW's for side projects. Anyways I found the car on eBay and picked it up. It's been solid for me and I've had no problems. The body has about 120K miles, and the engine has about 72K miles off a 98 Audi A4. Engine bay is cleanly shaved, battery was re-routed to the rear. Coilovers, exhaust. I have not been able to chip it and see what kind of extra oomph I can get out of the car, but it's decently quick. 

The car is pretty clean given it's age. It's certainly not perfect. There are a couple nicks on the bumpers. There is a tear in the stitching of the leather seats. Windshield will have to be replaced...my insurance isn't covering a free replacement for it. Car will not pass inspection, but I can help you with that. 

Any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. I'll deliver if needed, within reason. Will consider trades for a pickup truck. 

Text me at 617.697.9292 
Or Email 

$3500, firm...if it doesnt sell, I'm just gonna store it for the winter.

1960 Series II and 1960 Series IIA 88” Land Rovers, for parts only, no titles.  The 1960 Series II will run (I have heard it run with some gas added to carb) but it will need a fuel pump to run continuously.  The 64 Series IIA I have not heard run, its engine condition is unknown.  The frames have some rust (rear x-member mostly), and the 64’s frame might be saveable (needs rear x-member and one or two outriggers).  The 60’s frame is rough.  The 60 is a hardtop with tailgate and liftgate.  64 was a hardtop or station wagon but is missing roof, 3 doors, and gas tank.  Both have rusty bulkheads, but the 60’s bulkhead is the better of the two with rust confined to the footwells.  Many many good parts on both rovers.  The 60 Series II is complete save for one or two light lenses.  The RF fender of the 60 Series II is damaged.  Asking $1500 for both as a package.  Please email with any questions.  Photos are of the 1960 Series II.

I'm selling my '92 Audi S4, this is the very first year of the S4, and was limited to only 250 examples in North America. This S4 is Tornado Red with Ecru leather interior, with a 5 speed manual trans, and 210k miles. The car looks absolutely astounding, nearly brand new, and is completely rust-free, it spent it's entirely life in the north west, and the Mid-Atlantic, that combined with a triple-galvanized body (something absurd like that anyway), means there is no rust, and it's not likely to ever have any rust issues. The mileage isn't much of a concern either, there are examples out there being daily driven with well over 300k miles, and nearly every wear item on this car has been replaced within the past 15,000 miles. Here is a list of everything that has been done to the car recently:

Brief history of records:

Mechanicals:
- (within last 2500 miles) New head gasket, new valve cover gasket, some other gaskets, new breather hose to address small oil leak, new timing belt and serpentine belt, new crankshaft timing gear, new thermostat, new heater core and blower motor, and general tune-up including new air filter, new fuel filter, oil and filter change, and spark plugs.* New coils, replaced idle stabilization valve. Replaced windshield washer fluid tank.* Bled brakes. Alignment.
*
- (within last 15000 miles) Turbocharger professionally rebuilt, control arms replaced, new cam position sensor, timing position sensor, mass airflow sensor, and a bunch of other sensors.* New oil cooler lines, new transmission and motor mounts.* Replaced water pump and timing roller.* New power steering pump, starter, and alternator.* Replaced fuel pump and relay.
*
- I have also done a lot of peripheral work like replacing the bulbs in the instrument cluster, lubricating all the tracks for the power windows, clearing sunroof drains, and I addressed electrical issues.
*
Cosmetics:
- Repainted original red a couple of years ago.
- Replaced center section of tail lights because originals were cracked.
- New rear emblem
- New headliner and replaced A-pillar and B-pillar trim pieces as well as door pulls
- Replaced climate control head unit
- Replacement Elm wood trim to change from cracked pieces in the interior, in both front doors and center console
- New shift knob, the last available in the country according to Audi
- Replaced trim for front fenders, Audi football and lower trim
*
Modifications:
- European front bumper with correct Euro bumper mounts
- MTM chipset (giving it about 275 hp)
- Converted to Audi's 1.8T coils
- Bilstein HD struts with factory '92 springs
- Dahlback blow-off valve
- 034 Motorsport shortshift kit
- Zimmerman cross-drilled rotors
Samco hoses


The car needs absolutely nothing, it may need a coilpack in about 5k miles, but that's literally it. The car will pass inspection as is with flying colors (with the possible exception of the window tint, of course) it is in fantastic shape, and I hate to get rid of it, I'm only selling because I need something with more hauling space. So I'd consider a trade for some sort of truck or wagon... Something along the lines of a Ford F-150, Chevy Silveradom or Chevy Tahoe... I will also consider trading for a cheap motorcycle, plus cash on your end. Just PM or post here with any offers you may have.

But I certainly don't mind selling the car outright. I'm looking to get $5,500 obo for the car. It's located in Allston, MA, feel free to ask me with any questions, or to set up a time to come take a look at it. Thanks!

Red convertible, with black top and beige leather interior. Automatic transmission. 



Car is collision free. Roof and seats are weathered. 



It was almost exclusively used as a summer car, with an occasional ski trip 



I bought this car in 1988. 



The engine and transmission are sound (less than 90,000 original miles) but it does have a cracked exhaust manifold; its going to require a manifold. 



The transmission was replaced several months before I had taken off the road (somewhere I have a receipt… it had no more than 28000 miles on it) 



The car simply can’t be driven because of the exhaust manifold. It will need to be towed. 



It has not been driven in years because of manifold; I just start it once a year and bring it up to temperature. 



I have all maintenance records, as well as Saab official shop repair manuals. 



I love style and handling, it was my favorite car, so that’s why I kept it. 



My thinking was at some point I would get to the exhaust … but as it turns out I never got to it and I am selling the house where the car is parked, and have no place to put it. Nor do I have the time. 



$1050 or best offer; car is in Holden, MA. 



Please call Paul, after 10AM up til 10 PM, at: 617.299.6105.  Other numbers to reach him are: 978.283.6662 or 508.207.7687

First year of manufacture when the Supra became it's own model and no longer part of the Celica line. This car has less than 90K original miles and is in excellent condition. There is no rust ANYWHERE. I am the second owner. The original owner was 65 when he bought it so it has been extremely well taken care of and babied. It has every option that was available in 86 except the TEMS suspension. The A/C just stopped working last month. That is the only thing that does not work. All the power options like the seats and antenna function perfectly. The interior is leather that matches the exterior maroon color and has no rips or cracks. This cars runs like new and the transmission shifts perfectly. Up until recently I was driving it 150 miles daily to and from work in Springfield. I would not hesitate to drive this car anywhere. The engine is amazingly smooth and a joy to drive. The drive shaft has been replaced with an aluminum one-piece unit. Tires are excellent, there is a non-factory CD player. The original tool to take off the removable targa roof is still in its plastic pouch. This car is not perfect but is is also not a project car. NADA lists the value of this car between $2700 - $5000. Asking $3500. Send email with your contact information, phone or email, and I will return your call same day. Call 508.405.4292.

I am selling my 1997 Mitsubishi Mirage. Color is black. I love this car and it is comfortable with lots of room but the engine has died. Last 214,000 miles and never gave me one problem. I, honestly, wish that it was running or I could fix the motor myself because I liked the car this much, but it is just not so. If you are mechanical it will be a great deal for you. The car also comes equipped with a double cd/tape player. 

Would like to sell by 9/28/2010.  

thanks.

FS: 1988 BMW 325iX

Exterior: Diamond Schwartz Metallic
Interior: Cardinal Red
Miles: 218,xxx
Body: e30
Drive train: All Wheel Drive
Transmission: 5 speed
Overall Condition: Great
Location: Outside Boston

You’re looking at BMW’s first AWD vehicle, the 325iX. An amazing car in the wet and dry, this is from the first year made, build date 10/87. I haven’t even seen another car in this color combination. She comes fully loaded with everything that the 325iS had standard, plus the AWD system. I’ve done a TON of work in recent replacement parts and she drives great now. Don’t let the miles scare you, these cars can go twice that with simple regular maintenance. The car had records, but the previous owner tossed them before I got the car. Below is a list of the parts that I’ve replaces within the last 100 miles. The car is ready for a full time owner. She was well kept before me and I kept that tradition alive. AWD works perfectly.

Here is the wiki link if you are unfamiliar with the cars and their capability.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_3_Series_(E30)

Owners tend to hold on to them quite a bit and finding one in this condition is rare to say the least. The first year of production is when every option was standard and only sold as a 2 door coupe. Every subsequent year, BMW skimped on the standard options, and made the cars in automatic and 4 door. I’ve not driven the car much and I don’t have the space for a second car anymore so I have to let her go.

I believe I am the 4th owner, with the original owner selling the car only a few years ago. I was told that he used to let his son drive to Alaska and back (hence the mileage). Car has almost no rust at all (a bit in the trunk, behind the rear tire) and on the bottom inside of the driver’s door. Had a full OEM re-spray a few years ago and is in great condition. Nice and shiny. I believe there was a minor front end collision that was reported a few years back but there is no evidence of that besides the radiator mount being a bit miss-shaped, but straight. Car drives straight and has some decent tires on the OEM 15” wheels. Both LSD’s are in great condition.

Parts new and installed since I’ve had her (less that 100 miles driven!)

Engine:
• 2.5l M20B25
• Head Gasket (OEM)
• Head - Replaced with a low mileage (under 100k) unit since the original had a bit of valve train noise, but worked perfectly
• Spark Plugs
• Filter
• Oil
• Distributor Cap
• Rotor
• Coolant Temp sensor
• Power Steering Belt
• Valve Cover Gasket
• Timing Belt (OEM)
• Tensioner (OEM)
• Water Pump (OEM Metal Impeller)
• Throttle Body
• Injectors (replaced with used, lower mileage car)
• Coolant Flush
• O2 Sensor
• Idle Air Control Valve (IACV)
• Crank Position Sensor
• Fuel Pressure Regulator
• All Vacuum Hoses
• Brand new, full exhaust (including CAT)
• Exhaust gaskets

**all new fluids this past weekend 9/26 (Engine oil, both diffs, transfer case and transmission)**

Body:
• Rear Strut Bar
• Rear Subframe Poly Bushings (IE)
• Rear Trailing Arm Bushings (IE)
• Complete OEM Toolkit
• Battery
• Rear Wheel Bearings
• Front Tie Rods (Inner and Outer)
• Rear Differential Mount
• Gear Oil in the LSD’s
• Stainless Brake lines
• Full Brake Fluid Flush

Interior
• Full interior
o Almost mint condition Cardinal e30 M3 front seats (RARE)
o MINT Rear Cardinal Bench and back seat
o Carpet shampooed – looks great
• Gage Cluster (Gages replaced since the plastic gears were old and stripped)
• Aftermarket CD deck (Previous Owner’s install)

What the previous owner’s did (that I know of):
• BRAND NEW Transfer case (BMW Installed) at 180,000 miles
• Possibly clutch (grabs great)
• Rust repair under the battery tray, which is a common spot
• New shocks on all 4 corners (OEM – handles amazingly)
• Short Shifter

What the car comes with:
• Separate set of headlights (elipsoids, the good ones)
• 3 Oil filters
• Used Steering Universal
• 2 Front Axels
• Various Small Parts

What she still needs to get to 100%
Sway bar end links in the front (they creak a bit when turning)
Front Axel (Included in the sale are 2 rebuilt front axels (they are over 900 new, each)
Drivers side clicks at full lock and passenger’s side outer boot blew out
AC recharge (low pressure)
A driver (You!)

This is definitely a great car and I wish I could hold on to her, but I can’t have 2 cars in the driveway any longer. I’ve had her over a year while I’ve been making the repairs and I didn’t skimp on anything. This is a great second car to keep your nicer vehicle off the winter roads or a fun all year around car. Fun to drive, sweet 5 speed trans. No Check Engine Light. Will be getting an inspection sticker and a rebuilt tach this week (fuel and temp read correctly, speed and rpm do not – common issue on old clusters). Last would be a full PS flush, since the steering is a bit stiff, I have a new filter). I have the fender liners and lower dash covers that you don’t see in the pics.

$5000 OBO

*Interesting trades of equal value only also entertained*

You can contact me at trigtm(at)gmail.com or call/text me at seven eight one seven one zero six three eight six. I’m in no real hurry to sell the car and if I get around to fixing the things I mentioned above, she will be worth more when there is nothing wrong with her at all. I’m accepting offers so don’t be afraid to send something my way. I’d like to give her a good home and the worst thing I can say is ‘No’. This is a 23 year old car, it’s not perfect. It’s a good driver and with a bit more elbow grease, can be made into a great driver. Great price for a car in this condition and with these options!

I live just west of Boston and can meet you if you are serious about the car. I can also deliver the car up to 100 miles or get you in touch with a great transport company if you are further away.

Thanks for looking and let me know if you have any questions.

Selling a lincoln town car needs work mainly you would want to buy this just for the engine and transmission. the engine is a factory blue block rebuilt roughly 13k and the tranny is 100% rebuilt 13k. This is worth over 3,800 alone. The car it self needs exhaust work, catalytic converter, break work, and probably some other stuff,  as well as body work. 

Like i said this car is going to be sold just for the engine and transmission as I'm taking small parts out of it tonight.

Driving Impressions

Don't expect to pass unnoticed when driving an SSR. This car/pickup crossover draws plenty of attention on the road. Passersby can hear it coming because of its loud exhaust note, and they're likely to be enthralled by the sight of the SSR's retractable top in action. Standing-start performance is even more ferocious with the corrvette borrowed V-8.

 

VIN #MA32986

This car is reconstructed (perfectly I might add) and the title is re-issued by Massachusetts. The old VIN was removed and the new was added to the car that is why the title is not 17 digits. There is also a picture of title in the listing.

 

Up for sale is an amazing Pacific Blue 2005 SSR Roadster convertible. This roadster has been beautifuly reconstructed as it was in an accident and has a reconstucted title to match. The owner has rebuilt 7 others and all are painstakingly tested to insure everything runs as it should and looks great to boot. The frame was professionally straightened on a frame machine. We will supply all paperwork. It was then upgraded with the following extras:

 

 

Air Ride System - look closely at the pictures raised and unraised (it's amazing)

 

Full Chrome Package

 

Billet Grill

 

Running Boards

 

Magna Flow Exhaust

 

GPS - built into dash (never find that anywhere!)

 

K & N air filter (lasts forever)

 

American Racing Wheels with Toyo Proxis tires (minimal road wear)

 

2006 body on the 2005 frame & Drive-line

 

Heated power seats

 

 

 

The car has 15,000 miles on the odometer but had 10,000 original miles for a total of just 25,000. We will include original suspension if you want to put it back on.

 

The car looks looks almost new with the rebuilt exterior. There are no dents or problems of any kind. The car has passed inspection and is ready to go. 

 

 

 

Exterior

Chevrolet's Advanced Design family of trucks, produced from 1947 to 1953, inspired the SSR's styling, which features a sculpted hood and large flared fenders. The power retractable hardtop operates in 25 seconds, stacking roof panels vertically behind the passenger compartment. Cargo-bed volume, at 22.5 cubic feet, is the same with the roof up or down.



Measuring 191.4 inches long overall, the SSR rides a 116-inch wheelbase and uses body-on-frame construction. The cargo bed is approximately 4.2 feet long and 3.5 feet wide (at the wheelhousing).



Built on a modified version of the platform used for the Chevrolet TrailBlazer sport utility vehicle, the SSR features full-length hydroformed steel rails with eight cross-members. A lower stance and wider track are intended to increase stability and flatten cornering. Aluminum wheels hold Goodyear performance tires that measure 19 inches in front and 20 inches in the rear. No spare tire is included.



Interior

Two passengers fit inside the SSR, which features a twin-cockpit theme with body-colored accents and a horizontal aluminum-look bar spanning the width of the dashboard. Audio controls are hidden behind a movable panel.

 

Under the Hood - Corvette engine

The 6.0-liter LS2 V-8 produces 390 hp at 5,400 rpm and 405 pounds-feet of torque at 4,400 rpm. GM's 4L65-E four-speed-automatic transmission A Torsen differential distributes engine power to the wheel with the most traction; the automaker claims it will react before any wheel actually slips.



Safety

Four-wheel all-disc antilock brakes and side-impact airbags are standard.



Please call 781-344-1092 to set up a showing

I have a 1999 Eclispe GST for sale, I am the only owner.  The car has a 2 year old batt, a ported sub box 2-12 in subs.  2 amps pushing around 3000 peak.  Cat back stainless steel muffer. KN air filter pushing about 218 house power.  In the last 60 days I have installed a new timing belt, new idler, and changed the water pump at the same time.  In doing that i figured I would put a new Generator and starter.  The brakes are all pretty new as well,and back rotors are fine. Those where new in Feb of 2010. The A/C works great and has had a new charge. Then a few weeks ago i installed a 2 front rotors. The car also has a moon roof and wind protector.

The only minor works that it needs would be maybe new tires, they have maybe 10,000 miles left, wheels should be rechromed and the car only has 2 little spots of rust.  I would get these things fix if i were keeping the car.  But, I finally said i wanted a family car instead.

Please call me

Color of truck is red it haves 120,000 miles, runs and drives great starts right up every time. It haves two little problems the muffler needs to be welded back up and it needs a rear brake line fix those problems and you got a good running 4x4 truck. As is right now the truck would have to be towed which I will take care off. Im having trouble  getting pictures online but if you e-mail me your number I can text you a picture. Thanks, Nick

OK this is it, last drop in price. I will keep the car and fix it myself if not sold this time. I recently posted this car and got many responces. I promised car to 3 different people and they all let me down, I will not promise this car again, first 2000 gets it I will not wait for you, bring cash or risk loosing this car. I have lowered the price for quick sale. DON'T WASTE MY TIME WITH CHECK. 
Great car for parts. Body in great shape, wheels and tires with lots of good rubber 75%, engine 3.0 and very strong 70,000 miles,all leather interior excelent condition, very clean jag. Tranny slipping and front end problems. I love this car just don't have time to get her up and running properly. If you fixed the tranny and front end you would have a great car. This is an extremly fast smooth riding luxury sports car that needs to be fixed and what a car.

This is a 2000 Chevy Silverado 1500. It is a 2wd automatic with the 4.8L V8 motor. It has 151,000 on it but runs mint. The truck has zero rust. I have had it oil undercoated 2 times a year since I have owned it. It has new tires and also was re painted and pin striped this summer. It has a spectre air intake on it which gives the truck good gas mileage, and it also has a flowmaster muffler. Overall this is a excellent truck that runs great! I am firm at 4,000 or would consider a trade for a 4 door car. Feel free to email at or call 603 499 1140.

I didnt have any pics of the truck on my computer with the 22"s but the 22s really do make a huge difference
and these pics are a few months old so its from when the truck didnt have the flowmaster exhaust

Truck has 160k mi on it

What its got:

-22" rims with tires 305 wide and the rims are mint
-17" 2005 LT tahoe rims
-Leather seats
-Pioneer cd player with ipod hookup or I have an Alpine LCD flip-up screen with ipod hookup and 6 disc cd changer if you want that

I have all the paperwork of all work thats been done on this truck

Theres too much to list about this truck and its a MUST SEE its great

The only reason why I'm selling the truck is because I'm buying a a benz and benzes aren't cheap so I need money and I wont need the truck anymore
It runs great and I've been driving it everyday for the last 1 1/2 years

Im selling my VW Jetta because i moved to the city. Im selling it for how much i paid, even though ive put about $800 worth of work into, and ive only owned it for 6 months.

Has 145k miles on it, blue/navy, four door, great interior, automatic transmission, 2.0L, GI model, not sure if the AC works (it might just need a new charge), manual locks unless you want to go to VW and buy the power lock remote, brand new timing belt, new tires, just had the balancing and alignment done, new distributer cap, $600(at least) stereo system. Might need brakes and needs new muffler clamp (20 dollar fix).

This is definitely a perfect in-town car, first car for teenager or a project car.

Come by to look at it in Boston where i live or im willing to meet somewhere in the city. I can send pictures via email or picture messages. Feel free to ask any questions, this is an honest sale here. Just need the car gone ASAP.

9784063956 leave a message if i dont answer. Email for more pictures. No bullshit spam either, dont waste my time. Thank you! :)

Cherry red Dodge Intrepid for sale. Automatic and Manual transmission. 

Has an idle issue. Have no idea if it's small or significant. Car starts, revs itself a few times, then shuts off. AC and heat does not work either. Don't know why. A mechanic said it was a minor solution???? If you know a mechanic or have a hook up, this is a very sweet deal! Before these problems the car was running great.

The exterior is nice with few scratches and no dents. 

New battery, mirrors, tires, and other minor parts.
Leather interior, great engine, and working CD player!!

$900 or best offer. Willing to negotiate.

Serious inquiries only please.

Kelly Blue book valued this car at $2160.00 in fair condition. Looking for $800 FIRM. 95k miles, maroon 4 door all electric. Clear coat on sides of the trunk are pealing in spots but the  rest looks good. Car is in good working order aside from the A/C clutch is broke and needs to be replaced. Makes a loud noise when turned on due to the clutch hitting off other parts. "Service engine soon" light is also on due to this. I thought it was the oil needing to be changed that made the sensor go off but had it looked at by a mechanic and the ac compressor is whats doing it he said. At the junk yard part would be about $30-50 to fix this and new one roughly $100.00. All tan leather inside, power seats, windows, electric trunk. 8 Cylinder engine. Car is big, has a nice tan cloth top that is in great condition. There is a rip on the seat of the drivers seat. Very nice Caddy that will make someone really happy with a little tlc. 781-248-8619 Serious Inquiries Only

2005 Ebony Black GT Coupe	                   
I am the original adult (53 year old) owner and no-one has ever driven her other than me. Never been to the track and driven mostly as a show car and when ever I could, weather permitting. She has never seen a winter, only seen rain on the way to car shows. This car is never dirty… Award winner at Regional and local Mustang shows. Garaged all the time and covered when parked at my work place. To say I have babied her would be an understatement. She has gotten nothing but the best equipment and parts with oil changes every 3,000 miles with Ford motor oil only. This Mustang looks as good as she did the day I drove her off the dealership lot. I will admit she does have some very small road chips on the front end nose and a small scuff on right rear but nothing that anyone notices but me. To follow is a complete listing of all the mods done to improve handling and performance. This Mustang is a blast to drive and the looks you will get will never end or get old. Believe me this Mustang looks great, drives great, sounds great and handles better than most Shelby’s.

Selling my 2004 Saab 9-5 Aero. It's a 5-speed manual, black with sand beige sport ventilated and heated seats (rare option!), rear bridge spoiler, 17" 5-spoke Aero alloys, optional burled walnut dash panel (instead of the chintzy fake aluminum that came from the factory). Front tires are at about 1/3 life, and the rears are about 2/3 - Pirelli PZero Nero All-Season on all wheels. Has 121k highway miles on the odometer. As a highway car, the front bumper is a bit sandblasted but nothing too terrible. Recent clutch master cylinder replacement, idler pulleys and serpentine belt. There are a few nagging issues that will be fixed before sale including the throwout bearing on the clutch (a bit loud) and a new Direct Ignition cassette will be installed. This is a very powerful and elegant car for the discerning enthusiast. Minor performance enhancements include a K+N cold air system, Stage I ECU program and hotter camshafts. These enhancements not only provide a swifter driving experience, but also increases in overall fuel economy when driven sensibly.I am offering this car for $7000 and at that price, I am confident it will not last. I can be reached at 603-321-3213 anytime before 10pm. No tire kickers, please -- I will not accept trades of any kind, either.

Hello,

             I'm selling my car because I'm moving two blocks from work.  It has 170,000 miles, and is in good condition.  I just put in a new battery two weeks ago, and recently had my oil and coolant changed. The car also has a new exhaust, catalytic converter, and some new tires.  It's served me well over the past three years, now I hope it'll do the same for someone else.  This is priced to sell, so please feel free to inquire.  I'm moving soon, and I'd like to have the car sold by then.  It's white, has a moonroof, a few small scratches, but is still in good condition.  You should definitely get a new set of brake pads, and a tune-up.  These additions won't cost you much.  Thanks, and I look forward to hearing from you.

1973 Ford Mustang convertible 



Very nice condition. 351 Cleveland, 2V, auto, triple white, stock AM/FM radio, Decor group includes stripes, black rocker panel treatment, unique grille, chrome wheel well trim, false hood scoops.  Runs great, looks great, three coats urethane and three coats urethane clearcoat done in 2000 still has great shine.  The body and frame is solid, no rust.  Florida car. Tilt wheel, Good top with glass rear window. 131K miles, Lots of work done over the years, receipts after 1996 available. I have owned it since 1996. Still more can be done to make it perfect, but is a pleasure to drive and take to Cruise Nights. This car gets a lot of attention. The 73's are increasing in value and this one is a great find.  I just don't have the time to dedicate to it.   

Things it still needs: factory A/C present but not working, small leak in transmission,  Of course, the car is 37 years old, so is being sold as-is.  Price lowered - Don't let this go to someone else!



The price is at low end of blue book, but the condition is definitely middle of range.   If you see the car, you'll see that it's a good price for a very nice classic Mustang.  No trades.

I am selling this 1994 Wrangler 4 cyl, 5 speed because it has become a spare vehicle that does not get much use. It is in good condition with 142k miles. The body is pretty clean with minimal rust, and the wheels have been bed-lined black. The floors have no rust. The head gasket, intake/exhaust manifold gasket, and valve stem seals were replaced 2 months ago. It has had a full tune up (plugs, wires, coil, cap and rotor) all within 2,000 miles. The clutch was replaced at 110k miles. I have owned it since about 100k miles and about 5 years. The tires are good and slightly over-sized. The brakes work well and one of the lines was recently replaced. It runs and drives well, and cruises at 70mph with ease.


It has a hard top shown in pictures, a soft top and soft half doors that all come with it.


Feel free to contact me anytime by responding to this ad, or calling Mike: 508-517-5998. The price is best offer, I am looking to get rid of the jeep soon and it would make a great winter rig for someone. Feel free to call and ask any questions or request more pictures. Thanks for looking.

Up for sale is a 1986 Toyota Camry LE. It is a 4 speed automatic and the car has 140,000 miles on it. The only problem the car has is that it needs a new exhaust. In its current condition it blue books around 2200 and I am only asking 1200. I am only selling it because I don't have a use for it anymore, but I was using it to commute 495 and route 2 daily with no problems at all. The car also averages around 35 miles a gallon! I will also consider various 80's Japanese motorcycles for an even trade. Call me at 1-978-549-9765 and ask for Aaron. Thanks for looking!

I'm only the second owner of this Maxima.

1995 Nissan Maxima. Black, Auto, A/C, Cloth, Power Windows, Power Locks, 213,000 miles...I know it's a lot but many, many highway miles. Easton to Hingham commute. Overall the car runs well and was my daily driver up untill a week ago, got a great deal on a RAV. The car is currently registered and the sticker is good till February....(Will buy you a little time to make some repairs) Exhaust issues, needs resonator...but you can save the CAT and the muffler. The resonater piece that needs to be replaced is 140.00 at Auto Zone. Needs front brakes, but cheap money. The body is in good shape...small rust spot infront of drivers side front tire. The interior is really in good shape...well taken care of. ....just needs some attention and it could be a great car for someone.

Let me know if your interested.

I have a 1997 Ford expedition for sale. This truck is loaded with the exception of leather seats. 4X4 and has running boards. It has 200+K miles on the odo and has never been in a crash. But runs like great. The engine was recently changed. And all 5 tires (spare tire) were also changed. The only problem is the U joint might be wearing out (about $100 to fix both part and labor). This is a $900+ less than the kelly blue book fair value!! Its in "fair" conditions because of the U joint and I lost the key fob. Thats it for the downside. Please NO LOWBALLERS!!!! AND NO I WILL NOT SHIP IT. Reasonable offers will be considered. I don't want to sell it but I have too because money is too tight right now. Im looking to sell this quick. So email me if you are interested.

1996 Audi A4
For sale 1996 A4 2.8 Quattro Audi V6 158,000 miles


The car runs and drives. I have driven it for the last year every day but have purchased a new car. 


The car can come with the rims shown in the picture for an extra $350.00 firm. The rims are Zyoxx brand. were 1,800 new!! 2 are perfect and 2 have some curb rash but look so sick still and you could never go wrong at this price. They are very flashy and are pimp!


The car has a minor dent in the front bumper and fender. The car is a standard. I just put in a new clutch that cost $1300!

The car could use a couple things fixed on it but drives and looks so good for the price. needs a ball joint i think it was the mechanic said it was $300, a mirror, a patch in the exaust, a little love but the car is priced so cheap and will sell freekin quick! i just dont want to put a cent into it if im getting rid of it.


This car has a lot of great years ahead.  This car is a steal for the price. Reasonable trades welcome.


Give me a call or text if you want to take a look at it 802-683-4077

Car has never been in an accident, its in perfect shape, just blew 1350 on repairs, drives like a brand new car,  however there is faded paint all over the car, there are dings and scratches that are easily fixable and one siding on the exterior is rotted out at the end, electronically the car functions fine

I have a gorgeous 1996 Mercedes Benz S500, 4 door sedan. This car looks and runs amazing for a car 14 years old. It's dark blue, loaded with every possible option. The windows are tinted. I just had super white HID headlights and fog lights installed and are still under warranty. The car has a 5.0 V8, 320 hp. The drivers seat has some wear, but no rips. The rest of the interior is mint. The ash trays were never used. Has the original first aid kit. The trunk is spotless. It has 2004 AMG rims and tires. The rims are "staggard". I get compliments on the car all the time. I am only selling the car because my wife won't drive it because it's too big and too fast. The mileage is 160k, and if you know anything about these cars you know that these cars go to 300k easily. I have several pictures. Feel free to ask any questions. I will also entertain interesting trade, but please don't insult me. This car really speaks for itself. Thanks for looking.

1970 Chevrolet Impala Kingswood station wagon.Rare southern car,originally from Alabama.Green on green with chrome smoothie rims [I still have the original wheels and turbine style hubcaps and they will be included in the sale].I installed a brand new Goodwrench 350 crate motor in 2001 w/20K miles put on it since.Rear end was completely rebuilt with all new parts [gears,axles,bearings,all seals,the whole works] at the same time.Way too much other recent work to list here.It has a Turbo 350 automatic transmission,power steering,power disc brakes and ice cold factory AC.This is a great go anywhere driver but not a show car,does have some minor body issues but floors,frame and body mounts are clean and solid.The rear storage and spare tire wells [problem areas with old station wagons] are as clean as a whistle.Vinyl interior is in good original condition but has a couple of cracks in the dash pad,seat cover is torn on drivers side,headliner is damaged in a couple of places and it could use a new front carpet.I have owned this car for 10 years and would [and do!] drive it anywhere without a second thought or worry.It has been pretty much completely rebuilt mechanically from front to back and is turnkey and ready to drive.Currently registered and inspected with a clear Massachusetts title and is still driven on a regular basis. The car is 100% mechanically and has no serious issues.$5495 or best reasonable offer.Call 508-653-1194 [Days] or 508-429-5443 [Evenings and weekends]

This 2002 SAAB 9-3 SE Hatchback has 115,128 miles on it and is driven occasionally. It is front wheel drive with 4 channel ABS and Traction Control. I am the Service Manager at a SAAB dealer and have been for the past 9 years. I have owned this vehicle for approx. 5 months. I purchased it for my daughter with 110,310 miles on it in May 2010. My daughter has gone to college and did not want to take a car with her? So, instead of storing it and paying insurance on it, we decided to sell it. The vehicle has minor wear and tear on it, some small chips in the hood from over the years, some slight wear on the drivers seat bottom and side from getting in and out, slight bump on bottom of rear hatch (under the dealer name sign on rear hatch) where small rust spot may come through in a few years? The shark-fin antenna on the roof (for OnStar) is starting to crack and the drivers door weatherstrip has some wrinkles in it that do not impair it's function. Other than what I listed, everything else is functioning perfectly and working as it should. Now, what I have done to the vehicle:  New Direct Ignition Module and spark plugs, Engine air filter, Cabin air filter, Serpentine drive belt and pulley's, A/C Compressor, A/C is ice cold. New windshield, All new light bulbs throughout the vehicle, New antenna mast, SAAB information display (SID),  4 New Tires (Bridgestone Turanza Serenity 205/55/16 91H $506.00 from Tire Rack), New (4) Brake Pads and Rotors, Neutral safety switch, Complete exhaust systems looks fairly new? maybe a year or 2 old from previous owner and is all factory components, I installed Kleen-Wheel covers to eliminate brake dust on the rims. The rims are straight and have no damage. I installed a new front amplifier for front door speakers and upgraded all 6 speakers with JL Audio speakers and they sound great! I removed the engine oil pan when I first purchased the vehicle to make sure there was no sludge in the lower end and there wasn't, it was very clean. I did have a new oil pick up installed while the pan was off. I installed a new oil pressure switch. Re-torqued the cylinder head per a bulletin put out by SAAB several years ago, installed an auto-dim rear view mirror. I had the exterior and the interior treated with Simonize. The body and interior are in exceptional condition. There are no dents in this car! There are no leaks from anywhere! This car runs, looks and drives like a 2 year old car with 20K on it! My name is Joe. If you have any questions you can reach me at 617-719-0569 anytime. If you need more information or pictures, let me know and I'll take more and e-mail them to you. I will deliver the vehicle up to 30 miles. I will perform a complete detail on the vehicle for the new owner. Vehicle comes with 3 all in 1 programmed keys and dark rubber floor mats for winter. This vehicle is covered by the Massachusetts Used Car Lemon Law. If anything goes wrong with this vehicle? You can contact me and I can always help with any needed repairs. KBB suggested retail is $6700.00. KBB private party sale is $5100.00. With all the work and money put into this vehicle! I split the difference. $5900.00!!

Hello There! I'm selling my completely stock civic that I've bought last year from a Honda dealership. I'm the 2nd owner to own this vehicle and there are no problems with this vehicle. However, there is a dent on the front left bumper and a small dent on the driver's side fender as you can see from the pictures. Ever since I received this vehicle I've been giving it Mobil 1 fully synthetic oil every 3,000 miles. All maintenance schedules have been done on time and I have the paperwork to prove it. Most of these services were done at the dealership I bought the vehicle from, Weymouth Honda. I have no choice but to let this car go since I'll be starting school this Fall and I won't have the funds to continue in the Spring if I don't sell it. It is hard to find a bone stock Civic SI with such low mileage nowadays. Feel free to Carfax this car for further confidence.

Make: Honda
Year: 2000
Model: Civic
Trim: SI
Transmission: Manual 5-Speed
Mileage: 77,413

OK so i bought the truck a month or so ago and now i need to sell it to fund the newer truck that was given to me for real cheap. this truck is a retired State Police Explorer and only has 47K miles on it. it is all time 4x4 and perfect for the upcoming winter. basic options include none power windows, none power locks, none tilt steering wheel. it is four door and pretty damn clean interior as well. the outside is still painted like the Troopers cars but a quick job at Maaco will take care of that. truck runs great and would definitely still be used by myself had this other truck not get dropped in my lap so to speak.

few things that don't work on the truck: rear wiper, horn( figure its just a cut wire), also needs a muffler but will probably have fixed that soon, also the blower motor stopped working recently.

this truck runs strong and have used it for a month with out any trouble. the tires are still in good shape and the body doesn't have major damage/ or minor damage for that matter. really this truck is in great shape for the age and use it had.

any questions feel free to ask. it can be seen in Waltham, Ma most days of the week. feel free to come test drive the thing sometime.

Kelly Blue Book rates a truck in this shape as being $2925 for trade in value. Private Party Value is around $4000.

I am willing to knock off almost a thousand dollars to sell this thing maybe more if you have cash to make quick sale.

For sale a 2000 Hyundai Sonata GL. Runs great. 130073 miles. It needs a new catalytic converter before it can pass inspection here in MA. There is a bit of rust around both of the rear wheel wells (pictured) that probably needs to be taken care of as well. This is an awesome car and it runs great!

I am selling a 1997 Toyota Avalon Xls with 188K miles. I have had this car for several years, and it is very dependable. Never broke down with me on the side of the road and It never gave me any major problems. I always did my oil change on time. The engine runs strong with no leaks and the transmission shifts very smoothly. I never had any problems with it passing inspections. No rust, the paint is a little dull and faded, but that is normal for the year of the car. The leather seats are in mint condition, no tear. It comes with many options, Sun roof, power locks, power windows, ABS brakes, traction control, cruise control, heat, air conditioning, and an aftermarket CD player. It also has an automatic starter but I don’t have the remote for it. The only reason why I am selling this car is because I am in need of an SUV or a pickup truck to hall my DJ equipments back and forth. Otherwise, I would have driven it to the grown and I am sure it has many years left in it. People who are familiar with Toyota’s know what I am saying. The fair private value of this car is at 2700$, but I am asking 1800$ for it. The car is insured and ready for a test drive for any interested buyers. I am open to any reasonable offers. My name is Jean; I can be reached at 617-297-7194. Click on the link below to view the private party value at kbb.com

I am selling a 1994 Jeep wrangler 4 cylinder 143040 miles. There is a brand new best top soft top I had put on this year and a new pioneer cd player. It has 33" bfg's on it that are in good shape. Center console lock box and roll cage dual speaker setup. There is minor frame work needed on the right rear ( 6-8 inch section ) other than that the rest of the frame is decent. Also the tranny intermittenly will grind into 2nd and 3rd. This is a current daily driver but would need some work to pass inspection. Email me with any questions or if you want to take a look.

1990 Bentley Turbo R four door sport sedan.  Black exterior, black interior with grey piping.  385 horsepower turbocharged V-8.  71,000 miles.  Driven by the service manager at Bentley Boston and proclaimed to be one of the best examples he has driven.  Sold new in Los Vegas and taken to Florida, where it was a chauffeur driven car until I purchased it in 1990.  I have kept it in a heated garage for the 10 years I have owned it, have carefully maintained it, driven it gently, and never driven it in winter.  Designed to be Bentley's top of the line sport sedan, its performance and handling are amazing for a car of its size.  It was entirely hand built, including the 6.75 liter motor, which is so powerful, smooth, and durable that it will still used in the new $300,000 Bentley Mulsanne sedan to be introduced in 2011 and has been known to last 300,000 miles before needing a rebuild.  It has a reliable Bosch electrical system.  Twenty two hides were used to make the hand-stitched leather interior, which remains soft and supple.  The burled walnut dashboard trim and door caps are in excellent condition,  as are the Wilton wool carpets and headliner.  The sheepskin floor mats are a bit faded but still look great.  I had the dealer replace the tired original stereo with an excellent Nakamichi system with MB Quart speakers.  It has no dents or dings, and I am unaware of it ever being in an accident or having any paintwork done.  The paint makes a great overall impression, but close inspection reveals some of the stretch cracks in the lacquer paint that are present in virtually all Bentleys and Rolls Royces of this vintage.  



The Turbo R was one of the most expensive and desirable cars in the world in its day, costing more than the average American house.  This generation of cars was the last of the storied line of true English hand-made Rolls Royce/Bentleys produced by the independent company before Bentley was purchased by Volkswagon and Rolls Royce by BMW.  As such, it has outstanding potential for appreciation and can be purchased now for less than 10% of its replacement cost.  I have enjoyed this outstanding motorcar for ten years and hate to part with it, especially at a price that represents less than what I need to pay one year of my daughter's tuition, but it must be sacrificed.  Priced to sell now at $24,995.

Note: For restoration or parts — this car is not currently in running order.



Mediterranean blue w/ velour interior; 178K miles; second owner. Complete service records. Maintained since  100K at Glynn Motorsports until 2006.



Steering rack, rebuilt drive shaft, tie rod ends, wheel bearings, windshield, power steering pump, headlight assemblies — many good parts. Interior in good condition.

Last winter the hood latch stopped working, the battery died, and a linkage on the clutch let go.



$1000 or best offer this weekend, before I fix the hood and install a new battery; buyer responsible for towing.



Please include phone number to arrange viewing. Additional photos on request.

Offered for sale is this 1966 VW Beetle. I just drove it 3500 miles across this continent from CA to MA. To say it runs good is an understatement. It is mechanically very sound with many components replaced in the not too distant past according to its repair receipts. Included but not limited to this are shocks, ball joints, brakes, and clutch. All of the electrics work fine including the dome light. The tires are very nice. The speedo stopped working in South Dakota and it leaked about 1.25 quarts of oil during the trip. It has no rot and sports the original paint in the wheel well areas. The interior is very presentable and it has a modern day stereo system. The car has a 12 volt alternator and is wired as such. An issue the car has is it has been tapped in the left front. The front apron is solid and I believe it can be pulled as opposed to replaced for repair. The hood is somewhat funky in the front from the same accident as well as the driver’s door hinges have been played with a bit. I am asking $3800 for this very solid, very original , great running beetle. You will not find an East Coast Beetle in this non rotted condition and could easily spend that much on rot repair alone. Thank you 774-644 4547.

1996 Mercury Sable. car itself has over 200k miles but the good thing is the work is done..

I was given a newer 4x4 and want to sell to make my money back. $1500.00 or Best offer 
The car does need front tires to pass inspection but a set of four would not hurt.

This is one of my favorite vehicles,so much so I don't take it out very often for fear something might happen to it ,It is not replaceable and it would not be the same if it got damaged Can you imagine a 1968 with 25,000 miles that has never been painted?The interior is (and smells) like new,the paint on the hood has worn almost thru the primmer ,but if I painted it ,you couldn't see her originality. The engine is the original 345 v/8,automatic transmission,the built sheet is still on the visor ,she has tinted factory glass even though no air conditioning,When we do go for a ride she runs and drives 100% 508 333 8417

I just drove this nice running 2000 Ford F-150 truck up from Forida and may not be taking it back home. I have a 4x4 F-250 I'm driving back for my business down there and really don't feel like towing my F-150 back. If you're looking for a rust free southern truck that runs and drives good this is your chance to buy one for very little money. I'm leaving on Oct 2nd so don't wait too long to come check it out.

The truck has the 4.2 v6 engine with the 5-speed manual transmission and has 192,000 miles on it. We have used it for three years towing our landscape trailer with it with no trouble of any type.It has the heavy duty trailer hitch,bedliner and is wired for electric trailer brakes. It does have a few scatches on it but no real dents and looks nice with a blue/purple color. We just went through the brakes before driving it up here from Florida ( pulled my car trailer with a 1965 Mustang GT on it)

I'll try to borrow a camera to take some pictures of it but until then if you want to look at it you can come to Hudson, N.H. (8 River Road) 03051 and look it over. I'll be in the area most of the time so you can call me at # 603-320-3095.

I have a 2007 Cadillac CTS that I need to get rid of ASAP because I just landed a new job that gives me a company car and no longer need it.  This car is in great condition and has all the bells and whistles.  I am asking for $13,000 or b/o.  It has 68,000 miles on it.  It is listed for $14,560 under good condition on Kelly blue book so this is a steal.

Car Includes: Leather, IPOD interface, sunroof, rear spoiler, power steering, cd player and much more.  I would be more than glad to set up a meeting for you to look at it and give it a test drive.

It does need new tires and some paint on the front and rear bumper.....other than that it rides and smells like new.

Please contact me @ 617-721-8657 and ask for Erik.

This two door "Blazer" type was never used for plowing. It is automatic, 4wD, has many new parts with 150K on it. Everything is in good condition, tight ride, runs great, looks great, and should get another 50 to 100K with proper maintenance. New replacements during the last 15 months: Complete AC system, Power steering pump, Radiator, Battery, Brake shoes and Exhaust system, Computer, Plugs and wires last year. Tires have plenty of meat. tho the AM/FM radio does not work, has lots of static. No body damage, no fluid leaks, some minor rust/rot on the rear bumber and some rust on the tailgate door. Power door locks & windows, this truck is a great winter/summer vehicle.
 No problem getting a sticker with this vehicle
 I just bought a car, and have no use for two vehicles. If interested, leave your name, number and phone number. Larry

Chevy S-10 Pickup
148,000 miles
Taking best offer after October 5th.


I bought this S-10 four months ago for $2800.. the body is in great shape, everything else mechanical is in decent shape, but the tranny started slipping a month ago, and it finally shit the bed the other day.  I've had two mechanics look at it (Hoping I could get it repaired for around $500 bucks, but it doesn't look like its going to happen.. They both quoted me for $1000).  There is a hard top cover over the bed in good shape.  Visor cover, bug shield on hood, 1 rain guard on window.  I really wish I didn't have to get rid of this truck, but I don't have the $$ to get it fixed.  No rust on the body.

I would like to get $1500 for it, but I would take $1000 if it comes down to it.
The truck obviously doesn't move right now with no transmission, so pick up is required.
Email me if you have any questions, or if you would like to make an offer.  Like I said above, I will be taking the highest offer I receive prior to Oct 5th.

Thanks for looking,
E

I'm selling a 2001 Chevy Prizm.  



This is an excellent, dependable car that I hate to sell, but my grandmother gave me a great deal on her car so this one must be sold.



This car is great on gas.  Other great features include... automatic transmission, power windows & locks, remote car starter/door locks, sun roof, cd player and a good amount of trunk space.  Oil changes and other maintenance have been done religiously for the past 4 years that I've owned it.  This is a great dependable car, perfect for someone that wants an economical, gas friendly vehicle.  It would be great for a college student or first time driver too.  I hate to see it go but I can't drive two cars at once!



The car has 185,000 miles on it, and if you continue to do the oil changes and other maintenance like I have, it could last you another 100,000 miles.  



$3,000 or best offer.  Sold as is, by owner, with no warranty.  Needs minor work.



Email me through this ad, or call me at (774) 249-8101.



I don't expect the car to last at this price, but if this ad is still up the car is still for sale.  Act quickly!

2004 Black BMW 325Ci Automatic transmission with super low mileage!  54,000 miles!  The ONLY reason I am selling my car is because I moved to the city and have little to no use for a car right now.

I have kept up with inspections, oil changes and cosmetics/washing the car so it runs and looks great!

I have C280 with strong running engine and transmission, however it has a lot of rust on the body, high mileage (212K) and not passing emissions anymore due to worn out catalytic converters. I decided to part the car. It has good clean interior, all the electrics are functional, drivers headlight ( passengers is cracked ), bumpers are in good condition. Everything under the hood looks clean. Steering linkage is 1 year old. I also might consider to sell the car as a whole, however I will not provide a title ( I will provide a proof of ownership), and I will also replace original wheels with the other. Please e-mail me wit your questions. I will answer to all the messages.

1972 Datsun240z for sale-Original shiny paint with no rust. Yes no rust, never had it.

Only the second time in 38 years the car has been up for sale. It was owned by one family for 36 years and NEVER driven in the winter. The undercarriage and suspension still has original black paint on it. I bought it two years ago and put significant money into sprucing it up as I wanted a completely reliable fun car to drive on sunny days.



4 speed, 87,000 miles.

The body is all original, orange with white interior with new seat covers, padding and rugs.

It was always garaged and covered and it shows.

It runs smoothly, shifts like new, brakes like new and sounds excellent.

All gauges work including the clock.

Recent tune-up with plugs, wires, rotor, distributor cap and all fluids changed.

I had the entire suspension rebuilt with a new urethane master bushing kit, new struts, tie rod ends, ball joints so it rides like a brand new 1972 240Z.

The universal joints are all new and the clutch is still in great shape. My mechanic said there was no need to replace it even though I gave him the parts to do so.

New Vivid Racing 16” Rota RB silver wheels and Conti extreme contact 205-55VR-16 tires

New clutch slave and master cylinders.

Spoilers have been on the car since new.

Petronix electric ignition .

New rear brakes-fronts are fine.

New brake hoses-metal brake lines are fine.

Original radiator was cleaned and repainted-still in solid shape with new antifreeze.

Refinished steering wheel and new horn button.

Original owners manual and all original keys.

Original bill of sale from April 14, 1972 to original owner. ($4,576.00)

Original window sticker.

Dash is original and perfect.

Original set of rims and three hubcaps included.

There are a few minor dings and one small bump spot near the rear bumper that I purposely have not fixed as I do not want to lose the fact the body is all original with no paint work!

The interior once had orange shag carpeting (professionally installed but I removed it) and left small holes in the door panel upholstery.

“Not a trailer queen but a beautiful example of an unmolested first generation Z.”

This is a once in a lifetime find.

This trailer is a 44 ft. triple axle with three 7,000 lb. torsion axles and electric brakes on 6 wheels.  The trailer is for hauling either a funny car or dragster.  The trailer is all black on the outside and white inside skinned with .040 aluminum.  The trailer is really loaded.  It has an electric wench, it is loaded with cabinets, air conditioning, and has a Sanyo CD/AM/FM radio.  It also has an electric hydrolic wench for loading on truck.  It comes with a compressor and is plumbed in and out for air.  There is also an observation deck on top of the trailer.  This trailer new is over $30,000.00 and I am taking a great loss by selling it at this price.

If you are interested you can contact me at (617)304-4400.  Ask for Tony.

99 sts with 125k miles. Car is in excellent condition. Recent breaks perfect tires. Interior and body are in excellent condition. Everything works as it should. Problem is the motor spun a bearing and needs to be replaced. I've found several motors ranging between $900 and a$1000. Great car if you can do the motor swap. Or a great car for parts. Car can be started and driven. Let me know if interested. Firm on price.

Price firm.
80k miles approx
I need to get this thing out of my Dad's driveway before winter...  Dropped from $3000.
Engine runs great.  Because the car has been sitting and the electrical systems of the Allante, it may need a jump.  
Recent Servicings:  Brakes, Exhaust, brand new ignition.

Things that need fixing:

Soft Top needs replacing.

Broken plastic panel on inside of driver's side door.
Driver's side armrest came unscrewed.
Radio only works when the temperature suits it.
Small dent on front right.  Hardly noticeable.
Some of the Allante insignia have fallen of the body.
Engine looks and sounds lovely.

You could also part this car out and make a killing.  I'm just not the man for the job.

Tim
617.416.3675

The car could use a good going over but I might even pass inspection as is.  I just need this thing gone.  Had a wonderful time flying around VT with the top down.  This car screams.  It accelerates so fast it feel like you're being pushed into your seat.  And rides like a Caddy...  If I had a garage, i would keep it for the summer and leave the top down forever.  It's a blast.  My girlfriend keeps saying, "I miss that Caddy".  Tough.  I got things to do, woman.

Hello all.  Looking to sell my 1.8t Jetta 5spd manual (galactic blue) with lots of aftermarket parts.  This car has been my baby and I've taken good care of it for over 2 years now.  Had one previous owner before me who took good care of it as well.  My reason for selling the car is because I am a college student and its becoming too much of an expense for me.  It has 110k miles on it but runs perfectly and is up to date on all maintenance.  oil has been changed with fully synthetic ever 3k miles.  This engine has been perfectly maintained and still runs like new.  Timing belt, tensioners, pulleys, waterpump, and thermostat, all changed at 96k.  brakes were changed more recently.  If you have any additional questions feel free to give me a call. 1(781)-424-5107.
Here is what's in the car...

APR stage 1 software
GLI front and rear valences
Enkei Rs7 rims
Nexen n3000 ultra high performance summer tires
also comes with set of winter wheels and tires(toyo)
magnaflow catback exhaust
3" OBX racing stainless steel downpipe
Black Forest industries poly motor mounts
Forge 007 diverter valve
Evolution motorsports intake
spec stage 2+ clutch
Lightweight flywheel
autometer boost gauge
FK coilover suspension

Paint is in great condition the only flaw to the body is a small crack in the rear bumper with a little chipped paint but that has already been considered in the price.  Feel free to throw me and offer if you are interested.  Pictures coming soon.

my car is a 2002 wrx 2.0 4cyl turbo (td-04) it is a 5spd with symetrical awd. I am completely crazy about my cars i run rotellat motor oil in it cause it has zinc a phosforus in it to help keep the oil on all parts and protect them. The car runs super strong and tranny shifts perfect. The stock 2002 5spd trannys had problems with shifting into first at a low speed even you would have to come to a complete stop before the car could shift into first, not any more i talked to person after person and found the subaru wizzard. haha. well i'm now running motul and a red line mix for the tranny fluids and it shifts perfect and goes into first a 25mph if you want it too. My car was protuned by wicked innovatons who then commented to me saying "your motor is extremely strong and sounds very good". This car makes around 300 to the crank and you know it when you drive it. My wrx has a total of 139,000 miles on it now and go up daily i drive it everywhere mostly highway for commuting back and forth to school it has the following modifications:
 
-vishnu up pipe
-invidia 4" to 3" downpipe
-3" cat back
-STI top mount intercooler
-AEM intake with k+n filter with precharger
-ACT clutch holds up to 400 foot pounds
-ACT steel light weight flywheel 
-high performance timingbelt,rollers
-high flow water pump
-2006 wrx enkei wheels/white
-255 lph fuel pump
-solid heavy duty motor and tranny mounts
-MEGAN racing coilover suspension
-seibon carbon trunk
- center dash pod with atometer and depi gages
-DR-21 rims 
- kart boy shifter knob
 
NEW:
 
-starter
-battery
-brakes
-front axle boots
-tires
-water pump seals and crank seals
-all new shifter bushings
- solid motor and tranny mounts

probably much more i'm forgetting

1999 chevy s10 blazer with a 4.3 vortec motor with 50k miles. It has auto transmission with 132k. Push button 4-wheel drive, power windows, power door locks, power seat, power sunroof, privacy glass, Cd player radio with a tape deck on the center console. The interior is in good shape, the exterior is in great shape for the year. This truck is currently registered and can be taken for a test ride. I recently did the brakes all around, including rotors. The third O2 sensor and the starter were both replaced last week. the only things that need attention now to my knowledge is the E-brake system, a tire for the front left rim and a check engine light for a secondary air pump. When I bought it, it needed an engine and I had one installed from a 03 s10 with 50k miles. I also had a brand new Airtex fuel pump installed. I have driven this truck since it's been on the road in January. Everything works and it runs really strong. I would like to sell this truck by the weekend, so it will be sold to the best offer. If you are interested in this truck, please email me your offer with a number where you can be reached. I will call every one with a reasonable offer. I will delete the post when the truck is sold. Also I can't hold it for any one, the first person with a reasonable offer to show up will buy it.

**Reduced Price** 
This car was originally from Massachusetts and worked on, coincidentally, by my father who was a mechanic at Gaston Andre at the time. The original owner was very meticulous in taking care of the car, and it shows. My father and I moved to Vermont 7 years ago and later found that the Alfetta was sold to somebody who was in Vermont as well. We bought it with a blown head gasket and needing a clutch and brakes. Since completing that work (about 2 years ago) the car has been a daily driver, only in summer months. The odometer stopped working at 74k miles. I would guess there's around 100k miles on the car. There is some rust around the driver's side tail-light. We have a replacement panel that could be welded in place to clean it up (it never really bothered me that much). Other than that, and a couple small spots, the car is rust free. The interior is clean. The stitching on the front seats is beginning to separate at the seams. A CD player and better quality speakers were installed last year. We have also replaced the water pump, starter and tires within the last year. Sadly I'm moving and won't be able to take this Italian classic with me. 
The car is located in Burlington, Vermont. 
$2900/Best offer

1996 Ford F-150 short bed truck for sale by owner.  This truck has been owned and maintained by the same person for the last 12 years.  When I bought it it had 54,000 miles.  It now has 159,000 miles and it still runs great.  I'm selling it because I just don't have the use for it anymore.  In the last 2 years I have put in a new battery, done brake work, new tires, new water pump & have changed the oil every 3,000 miles.  There are currently a few problems but nothing major.  There are 2 fuel tanks and the rear one leaks so I just don't use it.  There is a small leak in the oil pan. (I've been told it would cost $400 to fix).  A section of the rear window behind the driver seat was broken and has not been fixed.  Kelley Blue Book says that with the current mileage and in FAIR condition this truck is worth $1655 so that's what I'm looking for.  THis truck has a V8 engine, bed liner, power steering, automatic transmission, great tires, Alpine CD stereo, Air Cond, and more...  Please call or email me to learn more.

Here's the KBB link: http://www.kbb.com/used-cars/subaru/legacy/2002/private-party-value/pricing-report?condition=fair&id=4756&category=wagon&equipment=183878|true|184015|true|184020|true|183939|true&mileage=82000



(make sure to copy full link- craigslist wouldn't let me use a link shortener...)



82000 miles.  5-speed manual.  I was second owner, and I bought it from a dealer (Patriot Subaru in Saco, ME).  Never used for daily commuting.  CD, tape, radio.  Very comfortable.  Always gave regular oil changes.  Treated her well, she treated me well.



The car is in Excellent shape mechanically.  Runs like a dream, purrs like a kitten.  However there is cosmetic damage including a dent in the rear left.  So, that's why on KBB I selected FAIR.  If you want a great car at a bargain because of cosmetic damage, than this is the perfect car for you.  



I'm asking $6000 or best offer, which is already way below the KBB Fair Value ($7300). 



Please feel free to email with any questions.  



Thanks for your interest!

Hello, I'm selling my Black 2003 Mercedes Benz E500. I had good luck with this vehicle and I'm sure it will do the same for you. The Engine and transmission are freshly young. The car runs smooth and drive off like a horse. Everything is in good condition except for the interior. It was recently vandalized. There are some rips on the the seats and door panels, a broken vent glass (which I purchased last week). The rips are not that bad but definitely noticeable. It has an in-dash 6 disc stereo system that sounds awsome. Needless to say it has keyless entry, 17" wheels, tan leather interior, power everything, dual heated seats, quad climate control, 8 airbags (unless I missed one lol). sun/moonroof, air suspension, telescopic wheel, too much to list. If you are in the market for a new car and don't mind putting a little fix in, this is it. I want to keep it but sadly have to part with it. please call me for an appointment to see the vehicle. you can email me but for a quicker answer call me @ 617-980-9963. Thanks for yor time.

Here I have my mother's old car an 1997 Acura Integra sedan Automatic. As I was driving it one weekend I didnt see the curve sticking out and drove onto the side walk. The bumper came off and the fenders bent but most devastating of all is the transmission went. 



-Other missing parts are the distributor/spark plugs and right control arm.



-The car has had a tune up oil change and a new motor installed. On the dashboard it indicates 266xxx miles of high way commuting to work, but the new motor only has 70xxx. 



-The ran really well and the interior is 10/10



Will have to be towed*

1987 Jeep Comanche

- 4x4

- 4cyl engine (good for about 22-25mpg in daily suburban driving. about 175k miles on the odometer.)

- manual 5speed transmission

- bedliner and bed cap included

- medium quasar blue DuPont paint, black detailing, black bed cap, chrome grill

- blue interior with black trim, faux leather bench seat

- tilting, removable sun roof

- Sony X-plode stereo: 4 speakers and cd/radio deck (circa 2003). can include Kenwood amp if interested (truck is not wired for it yet).



This truck has been well maintained and in the family since it was brand new. I have owned the truck for the last 8 years and taken meticulous notes of every bit of maintenance and repair work that I have done on it or have had done, including the date and mileage at each tune-up and repair.



The price tag is low because the transmission is currently stuck in reverse. This may be as simple to fix as replacing a connection between the shift knob and the transmission, but it would require the transmission to be removed to trouble shoot (which I can not do since I just moved into an apartment and do not have a garage to work in). The transmission also needs a new master clutch cylinder (slave and lines were replaced last year). Additionally, the floor boards in the cab need extensive repair, but this could be done quickly by any one with a welder and some sheet metal. The exterior is in pretty good shape for an old pick, as I had a lot of body work and the paint job done with I first took over ownership of the truck. The rear quarter panels are a little beat up from a collision, but the bumper was replaced since.



As I said, I had taken very good car of this truck and did almost all the work on it before the transmission went on it last year, so I know the vehicle inside and out and am happy to answer any questions about it, even after it is sold. I have a file full of receipts for parts, repairs and maintenance dating back to when the car was purchased brand new, and notes and receipts for everything I have done on it myself.







A set of 4 American Racing Outlaw II rims that fit the truck can also be purchased for an additional cost. They currently have low profile tires on them, but they almost need replacing.

New tires







Valid MA inspection sticker







The van runs and drives fine, everything functions as it should EXCEPT the A/C is currently not working. (may need to be recharged). Great van we just no longer need it as are family member that used it is recovering and is no longer in a wheel chair. We have two captains chairs that can go in place of the wheel chair lift  if you wish to just make it a regular van and sell the lift (which was almost our asking price alone when new). The inside is very nice with wood trim, a TV  and a power fold down bed in the back. The outside is in great shape with one minor crack in the plastic on the back door which is unnoticable from 20ft away.

** Honda Accord 1997 **

1997 Honda Accord.  Goldish Silver, Automatic, Runs and drives excellent, even on the highway.  New brakes, newer tires, power 

windows, sunroof, CD player, keyless entry, factory alloy rims, (not cheesey hubcaps), A/C blows ice cold, heat blows hot.  A very safe, 

reliable car, amazing gas mileage!  158,000 miles.  Timing belt and water pump have been done as manufacturers maintaince schedule 

suggest at 120,000.  DO NOT buy a honda with high mileage unless this has been done.  Not a fun or cheap repair.  Mechanically, this 

car runs perfect!  Come take it for a test drive.  There is some rust, dings, dents, scratches...but normal for age of car.  Excellent car for 

long commute to work, students, or new teenage drivers.  Call today to schedule a test drive.  Theres nothing you need to do to this car 

but drive it home!

Have a high ticket classic ? ( 1965 - 1967 Original Big Block Corvette ), ( Porsche 356 Speedster ), (Hemi), ( 32 / 34 Ford 3 Window ). Have a Ferrari 360 430 ? 997 Porsche Turbo Cab ? I have a small collection of quality cars but lack room for them. Recently moved and leased the portion of the building I used to store them in. Looking to trade 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 of my cars for one of the above. I am not in the selling mood doing the eBay thing and all of that. I just want to downsize the amount of vehicles not the value. I own all of my cars and can be seen in the seacoast area of NH. Shoot me an email with what you own and I will respond quickly if you have any of the above cars and wish to move on. Sometimes selling off 4 $30,000 cars may be more tedious but easier in some respects than selling a $120 car in todays climate.

White VW Jetta Wolfsburg edition 4-door sedan in sparkling condition!

Year is 1999 and mileage is 87,800, so it runs like it's younger. Manual 5-gear transmission with a very forgiving clutch. All scheduled maintenance has been performed perfectly and on-time. Bumper, steering wheel column, brake pads and e-brake have been replaced within the last year; plugs and wires within the last 3. Rotors were turned in April. Has a huge trunk for lots of storage and a 6-CD changer in the back. Interior is black cloth. There's an approximately 2-square inch spot of rust on the left rear that I'll be happy to have fixed prior to final sale.

I've never had any problems with this car--it's a gem. Email if interested!

1988 JEEP COMMANCHE, 173hp fuel-injected 4.0 L, 242 CID AMC 242 inline-six, rear wheel drive not 4 x 4.

Engine supposedly runs, battery dead, I'm working on that
5 aluminum mags probably could be cleaned up pretty nicely
Decent hood
Decent tailgate
Good passenger side fender
Most all glass is excellent, including rear sliding window
5 speed transmission
All four wheel skirts appear to be good
Engine, supspension, trans & drive train parts are all intact (Rat Rod/ Hot Rod Roadster donor?)
Body panels are all pretty straight, but have rust in the usual places, potentially could be repair material if yours got crushed off-roading

I can sell it complete for $500 or will part it out, whichever comes first. I have title. Call or email me for details. Delivery may also be available.

Im selling my 06 Cobalt SS "Sport" with the VVT 2.4L Engine.  The car has Salvage/Rebuilt Title which was how i bought it with 43k on it. I had been rear-ended about 2 months ago and had the body shop start the repairs, but i decided to sell as-is due to the fact i was taking it off the road for winter then selling anyway (I'm a truck person I don't like the small car).  This car has given me NO problems and it is 100% road worthy, NO frame damage, no mechanical damage its all body repair. Has 53K on the odometer, custom Sunburst Orange metallic paint, loaded to the max..Last 3 pics ARE what it looks like right now really need to see in person. Stock 17's come on the car as long as stock headlights.

Selling my rare 1990 Jeep Cherokee LIMITED. 4X4, Leather, Power Windows, automatic 4.0 with 145k original miles. Runs excellent, drives straight and tight. A real head turner. The Limited’s are getting very hard to find and I have never seen another one in this condition. People always comment and nobody believes it’s a 1990. The body and paint are in excellent shape. The original owner always garaged it and it shows. I bought it stock and have put A LOT of time and money into it. 



3’’ Rough Country Lift Kit 

31’’ BFGs on 15x10 M/Ts 

Grill Guard with fog lights 



In the past year I have replaced: 

upper/lower ball joints 

axle joints 

added a steering stabilizer

rear main seal 

battery 

alternator 

starter 

ignition coil 

tune up and new belt 

front end alignment 

installed custom intake and lous custom exhaust 



Only known issues are the reverse lights usually don’t work and the A/C doesn’t blow cold. 



Overall this Jeep’s very reliable and has been a lot of fun to own. I'd love to keep it, but I want a pickup.  
(781) 775-2234. If your into Jeeps this is a must see truck, come take a look. $3,500 is FIRM.

1986 Monte Carlo LS 2 door coupe. It is a very solid car with just 100k miles on the original 305 engine! I took a photo of the odometer and the title will show it has not rolled over!
Has power locks and windows, and factory AC (needs recharge/repair) And the interior is nice with no rips and the headliner is completely intact!
I worked on it for about 6 years, has a recent magnaflow exhaust, brake pads, radiator, edelbrock 650cfm carb, high output alternator and good battery. Runs strong and sounds great!
Alpine stereo w/ ipod control (connects in the glove box) sounds great and wired for two amps (8 & 4 guage trunk hookups)
This was my uncles car and was garaged for the 18 years he owned it. The car is in need of a head gasket but that is the only major problem.
Serious inquiries only you can email me at 1986monteLS@gmail.com asking $2900 but all reasonable offers wil be considered.

Hi, I have a great little baby benz here. 1992 Mercedes 190e 2.3 with 112,300 miles. Great interior few minor minor flaws. Synthetic oil every 3-4k miles, just did a Mobil 1 oil change with filter yesterday. Great running car, bunch of new parts, great on gas ( about 25 mpg), and stylish. Has sound system and interior neon ( both of which can be removed very easily.) It has 2 10" Kicker cvr's with a 1200 watt amp, sounds really nice, always got looks and compliments.( If you are interested in the sound system we can work out a deal on the price.) Looking to sell or trade for a truck. ( Need a truck anyway for work) Any offers shoot me an email or give me a call. Thanks ( If you are trying to trade a truck, send pics with the email) Dylan-508-472-1147



New parts : 

New Mercedes Benz battery

alternator

drivers side tie rod end

4 tires with 75% tread left

spark plugs

spark plug wires

air filter

driver's front ball joint



The Bad:
3/4 windows are not working. Drivers side hopefully getting fixed tomorrow or the next day. ( so the 2 back ones don't work)
and no A/C.

Just lowered the price to $2,300 but it won't keep going down this car is not a piece of junk I just need a truck!

Need a good, solid, working auto to get around?  This Olds has a LOT of life left in it.  115K miles, 3.8L, V6, only 2 owners since 1988.  Have all paperwork to support the 2 sales, as well as all receipts for all work done on this car since 1988.  It runs great, ALWAYS starts, even in the cold of winter.  Only thing it needs is a new caliper on one of the rear brakes.  Has some minor dings and scratches, but you will not be disappointed if you want a cheap car that RUNS GREAT, and is dependable.  

Toronado is a 2 door sporty look vehicle - not your grandmother's car.  The Toronado was structurally related to the 1966 rear-wheel-drive Buick Riviera and the following year's Cadillac Eldorado, although each had quite different styling.  The Toronado is front wheel drive.  Attached picture gives you an idea of what the 1988 Toronado body looks like - car is royal blue.

Due to a recent family addition i must sell my jeep. It's a 2004 Jeep wrangler rubicon. It's in great shape and has always been maintained. It currently has 82xxx on the clock and is currently my daily driver. It has a 5 speed manual transmission. It's pretty much all stock with the exception of cragar rims, the differential locker switch modification, flowmaster exhaust and a cb radio. This jeep has always been reliable and has never given me any issues. It has good brakes with newer braided stainless lines up front, all fluids are recent, it has brand new shocks, brand new steering stabilizer, it has a current inspection sticker and will pass with no issues. The soft top is only a year or two old so it's in perfect shape. This jeep has only been lightly off road once and it did amazing. I'm looking for $12500 or best reasonable offer. I really don't need to sell it but i'd like more space. For any serious offers or questions feel free to email me. Thank you.

I have a 1993 Chevy suburban that needs a new home; I have too many cars so this one must go. 176,000 + miles It has new brake lines from master cylinder to rear end, set of front lines not installed, new pads and rotors up front, recent muffler, tires that don’t have to many miles on them, barn doors, 3rd seat, alpine stereo. This has been our backup car for the last 5 years, I bought it new in Oklahoma and it spent the first 6 years of its life rust free. I am asking $1200.00 the new parts and tires alone are worth that. Call me at 978-812-9132 if I don’t answer leave a message I will get back to you. I will not answer email so don’t bother typing.

This is a great car and it has always gotten me from where I was to where I needed to go. The value of this car ranges from 10,500 to 12,500 but with the two minor flaws of this vehicle (neither impacting the performance of the vehicle, cosmetic only) I have it priced to sell at $9,500.
This is a great deal and this car is LOADED! There are so many extras you'll still be finding things out a year after you buy it. You can look all you want but you won't find this good a deal anywhere else, I guarantee it.

There are two and ONLY two downsides to this car.
#1- There is a dent in the rear driver's side door. I've gotten it appraised multiple times at multiple places at $500-800 to fix. This explains the drop in price as explained above.
#2- The glass part of the passenger's side-view mirror is broken. The motor is still fine and it is an easy fix. I got it appraised to fix for $40. I anticipate fixing it this week if this car doesn't sell before then.
Again, these flaws were taken into consideration and the asking price reflects such. It is well below the value of the vehicle and you could, if you so desired, fix both of these things and still end up saving money on buying this vehicle.

Please, no phone calls. I'm very busy and rarely have time to talk. I always have time to check my e-mail though, as I get alerted right to my phone and can check it from there.
No phone calls please, e-mails only.
If you want to work out a time to come see the car and potentially give it a test ride I'll release my phone number to you and we can work something out at a later date.

NOTE:  I've had this previously posted, but was unavailable to show.  I'm having ankle surgery tomorrow, so I will be home for the next week and will be able to show this weekend.  I will be unable to push this back into the garage, for a few months, so I want to get this sold before winter. Also, the photographs were taken8/15/10; the date on the camera is off.


2000 Jeep Wrangler TJ - 4 cyclinder, manual tansmission. ~45k miles


I posted this a few months ago and had a buyer all lined up.  After pulling me around for two months, he ended up not being able to come up with the cash.  I'd like to use the money to buy a sailboat before the end of the summer, so at this point I'm a motivated seller!  May also consider other trades.

Includes full hard top and steel doors. Asking price also includes any and all spare parts I have laying around my garage, including drive shafts, fuel tank, u joints, etc. etc.

Modifications:

- Custom built/welded front sport cage by Full Tilt Fab

- 33 Engineering Tummy Tucker skid (~ 3 inches ground clearance)

- 1" Body lift to clear tummy tuck

- rear full carrier Detroit locker (and 2 extra axles shafts, but I've never broken any)

- Advanced Adapters slip yoke eliminator 

- Rubicon springs with less than 10k miles on them (~ 1.5 inches lift)

- 31" mud-terrain tires (~50% tred)

- Warn front bumper, power steering box skid, fuel tank skid

- Superwinch 9,000 lbs. winch

- Optima Yellow top battery

- ARB safari snorkel



Right now it's been sitting in my garage for a year. It will run fine, but needs a fuel pump to run. It has been used off road, so it's got the usual scratches, dings and dents from that. No rust on the body or windshield frame. 



Bring cash and a trailer and come and get it. Or make an offer. If you don't want the top, doors, and winch I'd be willing to negotiate.



I built it to be a sleeper - the guys with the big lifts and big tires, transfercase drops and open diffs look and say "I couldn't make it up that - there's no way you can!" and next thing you know I'm at the top looking down.



Looking for cash (that talks), but will entertain the following offers for partial or full trade:

- A Late 70's Ducati sport 750 in running/ridable or better condition

- A smaller displacement classic honda motorcycle in good to excellent condition

- A nice ratrod bobber

- A sailboat and trailer in good to excellent condition - looking for a trailer-crusier in the 18-25 ft. range with a swing keel or centerboard.

- One or two sea kayaks, NOT sit-on-top, in good to excellent condition

- A personal water craft (jet ski) with trailer

- A two-up snowmobile with trailer

Car is titled as a 1965 Ford Cobra so there are no inspection issues and it is currently registered and inspected in MA.

I may consider a late C4, or C5 Corvette with low miles or some other interesting rides as part payment. Must be an automatic due to knee problems.

Price is reduced to $38,000

Please call Jim with any additional questions, 617-803-1532, before 9 PM.

1999 white vw cabrio with 126k, has developed a lower engine knock. Repair shop says it could run a while, could die soon. Estimated Repair bill too much for me. Have had the car since new, has recent tires, wires, muffler, battery, struts, etc. Just can't take the chance of an early death on the road. In the right hands could be a deal. Looking for best offer.

Runs fine. Good condition. Car was originally a gold package car, so fancy alloy wheels, some wood grain trim, nice stereo, spoiler. Fold down rear seats. Power locks and windows, tilt and cruise. Automatic transmission. No drips anywhere. Parked in garage for last 10 years. Car was hit and run again in parking lot. Broke mounting points for both headlights and some mounting points for front bumper. Now bumper sags a little bit, but most people will not notice the gaps are off a little bit. The headlights themselves were replaced before this, so are extremely new looking. Someone who likes to do body work should be able to make front look better without replacing any parts, just shoot a few screws or welds into the right places. Car is fine the way it is. No one has ever noticed the damage even though they see the car all the time. I have driven it like this for 2 years, should pass inspection still, did last time, sticker good till 01/2011. Carfax should show this car with clean title, it did before. Might need minor exhaust repair. I noticed a little more exhaust noise, if you are not used to the sound of this car you might think it is normal, but you may need to patch a pipe somewhere. 2 tires are great, front 2 are worse, but should pass inspection. Battery should have 3 years left in it. Brakes were totally replaced, rotors, pads, hosed, maybe some more parts 25K ago so should last a long time. Car has never stranded me, I owned it for 10 years, everything works, A/C is cold, no noises from pumps or anything. So in short, there maybe nothing you have to do right away. Things you might want to do soon is patch the exhaust, get better front tires or rotate them, and if ambitious, fine tune the headlights and bumper alignment

160Kmi 6cyl body in good shape, interior in good shape maroon cloth very clean no rips. Power locks, am/fm radio, inspection stick new on 9-10-2010, new battery on 9-27. I bought his at the start of the summer to get the kids around to all their stuff but a lay off at work forces sale or trade for a truck. I have only put a few miles on all summer and for the age and miles the car is in good shape, maybe a 2nd car or 1st car for your kid. I will trade for a truck no junk please something I can jump right in and work out of, let me know what you have.

A/C 134a conversion just done with NEW $400 upgraded compressor & dryer – ice cold A/C!!! 



Some modifications to the body were made such as a 355 Ferr@ri front nose, removal of all emblems, custom side rear body panels, fastback custom made side panels added to the rear body and a black rear wing 



The decklid was also modified and narrowed a bit to clear the rear side panels.

Thanks for looking; this car is very, very reasonably priced.

1998 Mercury Grand Marquis LS Park Lane edition, green with vinyl top, good condition cloth interior, very clean with no body damage or rust to speak of.  This vehicle has had one owner and well maintained.  Best of all, it has only 64,800 miles.  However, it needs front-end work mainly the ball joints on the driver's side.  It would make a great first car for a juvenile operator or a second vehicle once the front end is repaired.  The driver's side front tire also needs to be replaced, but the other tires are fairly new.  Asking $1500.00 or best reasonable offer.  It's a fair price for an older car with very low miles.
